Here they come, the freckled and pale, the dark and brooding alike. St. Patrick’s Day is upon us in Manhattan, a SantaCon in green. If you didn’t corn your own beef for dinner tonight, you can still buy a bag of the processed variety and simmer it off, or stop at the best deli in town to buy a couple of pounds. Crisp what you have under the broiler: Irish tacos are on the menu as promised, and they’re as fine as the air in Gweedore. What I’d like to cook this weekend: red flannel hash, off instruction Mark Bittman got a few years ago from the chef Jessica Koslow, of Sqirl in Los Angeles, to use up my leftover corned beef. Put some eggs on that and you’ll be in heaven. Also: these giant sourdough pancakes studded with fruit that Tejal Rao just wrote about this week in her sweet column for The New York Times Magazine. (You do have a sourdough starter, right? We talked about this a year ago!) Wouldn’t it be nice this weekend to learn to bake a soufflé? And to roast a chicken on top of all the bread that’s gone stale since you bought it fresh before the storm on Tuesday? You could roast tofu and squash. You could make lobster mac and cheese! And you could set yourself up nicely for a week’s worth of     desk lunches by making the best roast beef for sandwiches, a vat of black bean soup and (more Jessica Koslow action!) some brown rice for a midweek rice bowl with Swiss chard and chorizo. Those are all fine weekend projects. Thousands and thousands more recipes to cook this weekend are on Cooking. (Do you dare make Florence Fabricant’s new recipe for an oyster and blue cheese pie, which uses a cool technique for cooking the oysters that she learned from the chef Fredrik Berselius of the Nordic restaurant Aska, in Brooklyn?) See what you find. Save the ones you’re interested in making to your recipe box. And then rate them when you’re finished cooking and eating. You can  —   and should!  —   leave notes on the recipes for yourself or for the public, at least if you have an interesting point to make about the process of cooking them, or successful ingredient substitutions to trumpet. And, of course, if you run into trouble with the technology or the recipes themselves, do ask for help. We’re at cookingcare@nytimes. com. Now, in case you were wondering what Irish politicians think of Beyoncé, here’s some good work from The Daily Edge. I was going to suggest that if you’re looking for a ribald thriller in the tradition of Bond, that you check out Gérard de Villiers’s “Surface to Air. ” But I can’t. It’s too racy! It’s like “007 Shades of Gray”! But do you think you could add rainbow sprinkles to this recipe, to complete the trifecta of   ingredients and techniques? Maybe! Have a great weekend. I’ll be back on Sunday.

I have a column in The Times Magazine today about a recipe for roasted potato hash that I’ve been messing around with for years now. It makes a superlative bed for eggs and an excellent side dish for steak. You could eat it with a mess of sautéed greens and be happy without the animal protein. You should make it entirely your own. Perhaps you could make it for lunch? And then for dinner tonight, you could try the recipe for braised chicken legs that I learned from the teachings of the California chef Cal Peternell, and sop up the sauce with Julia Moskin’s recipe for grilled garlic bread. On Monday night, you might go meatless and Balkan, mixing up David Tanis’s recipe for a Greek tomato salad and adding some crumbled feta if you like to make it really sing. Or you could go Brazilian in honor of the Olympic Games, with 10 recipes from that nation’s larder. For sure on Tuesday you could give Martha Rose Shulman’s recipe for   shrimp with spicy greens a try. Serve it with Kim Severson’s can’  rice and then settle in to see what the Olympics have to offer. (You’re not, like, in Rio, are you? If you are, or just want to imagine that you are, Florence Fabricant has a fine guide to the city’s best restaurant options.) Wednesday night could be good for a steak seared in a   pan and served with a platter of sautéed summer squash with red pepper and onion, along with leftover rice or a baguette and butter. Then on Thursday night just order a pizza and make Melissa’s recipe for eggplant with lamb, tomato and pine nuts while or after you eat it, in advance of serving a really incredible dish  —   one that benefits from overnight resting  —   on Friday night, as we head into the weekend. Thus fortified, you can wake up on Saturday morning, head to the market and return home to make jam. Go look around on Cooking to discover other things to cook this week. (This recipe for pork chops puttanesca, for instance.) And, if you like, tell us about what you make. We’re on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest, where we use and applaud the hashtag #NYTCooking. If you run into problems along the way, don’t hesitate to ask for help: cookingcare@nytimes. com. Or if you have a particular question about food or cooking, kitchens or life in and around them, submit it to foodeditor@nytimes. com. I’ll be collecting the best of them to answer in a forthcoming “Hey, Mr. Food Editor” column for Men’s Style. Now, see if you can’t find an actual print copy of The Times today. In it we have a beautiful special section devoted to an excerpt from Colson Whitehead’s new novel, “The Underground Railroad. ” Or, if you want to stay online only, try this fascinating account of life as a paramedic in the border town of Laredo, Tex. in California Sunday. Watch the trailer for “Little Men. ” Read Tessa Hadley’s new short story, “Dido’s Lament,” in The New Yorker. And watch Melissa cook the   “impossible meat” that you may have been hearing about, on Facebook. See you tomorrow.

Nigella Lawson wrote a terrific article for us a few years ago about the pleasures of cooking ahead rather than, as the French put it, à la minute. She included in it a recipe that would become one of our favorites for fall: spiced beef in red wine. You could make that today, cool it, bag it in single portions and freeze them for use later  —   order in some Chinese food for dinner. Or you could just eat it for dinner tonight, accompanied by some rice, or polenta. Fall Sundays are great for   either way. On Monday night, if you’re not celebrating Rosh Hashana, maybe give Anna Jones’s recipe for a   spaghetti dinner with tomatoes and kale a try. As our Tejal Rao wrote last week, “you boil the raw pasta not just with water, but also with halved cherry tomatoes, lemon zest and greens. By the time the pasta has cooked, the liquids have reduced to form a thick, starchy sauce. ” At the start of the week, that sounds pretty great. Of course, if it’s not just the start of the week for you, but the start of a new year, maybe you’ll need more substantial fare. Cooking Melissa Clark’s  braised brisket with plums, star anise and port today will allow it to cure nicely in the refrigerator overnight. Reheat and serve! While you’re at it, give one of Joan Nathan’s new recipes for a Rosh Hashana dessert a try. Choose between a plum almond tart and an apple cider honey cake. Or make both. On Tuesday, maybe you could cook Melissa’s recipe for sweet and spicy roast chicken? (It’s awesome with couscous.) Or Mark Bittman’s  curried tofu with soy sauce? Wednesday, we’re eating fish. Would you like some salmon with parsley sauce? Or some arctic char with spinach butter? If it’s chilly enough, and you have a fireplace (lucky you) you could make Tamar Adler’s  fireplace trout. Read Trollope afterward by candlelight, and check on the horses before bed. Then, on Thursday, how about a warm bread salad to beat all bread salads, from the indefatigable Florence Fabricant, via the late, great Judy Rodgers? Accept no substitutions. And then on Friday night, you could wrap the week up with a big, fat turkey meatloaf. Or if that does not inspire, with a thick   steak. No? O. K. let’s make it a quinoa and rice bowl and call it a week. There are many, many more recipes on Cooking that you might make this week. Please save the ones you’re interested in to your recipe box, and rate them when you’re done cooking. (Share them around, as well, on email and social media: People you know need to see, right now, this easy, awesome Nancy Silverton recipe for roasted chicken thighs.) And if you run into trouble, or have something to tell us for good or for ill: cookingcare@nytimes. com. Operators are standing by. Now, do you know the term “subtweet”? Here’s an example of an excellent one, from Michiko Kakutani  —   and it’s not even on Twitter! See you tomorrow.

1 - Sam Sifton emails readers of Cooking five days a week to talk about food and suggest recipes. That email also appears here. To receive it in your inbox, register here. Good morning. Here’s the plan for the week, not including breakfast because I’m on a farina kick and that’s not to everyone’s taste, and not including lunch because really when it comes to the midday hours you should get out of the office or the house and walk around. If you get something to eat, great, but the most important thing is to be outside where the stories are. There’s nothing happening at your desk but a screen. Anyway! I’m thinking chicken paprikash for dinner tonight, a nod toward the coming fall, served over buttery egg noodles, with green beans on the side. If you have the time, make an apple cake for dessert. On Monday night, it would be great to eat falafel, but that means you’ll need to get and soak some dried chickpeas this evening. Fry them on Monday, and eat cut watermelon for dessert. Then on Tuesday, you could simmer Melissa Clark’s outstanding recipe for a smoky fish chowder into existence, serve it with soda crackers, and offer ice cream for dessert. (You can make your own. We’ve been grooving on Gifford’s recently, for what that’s worth.) Wednesday, maybe try Mark Bittman’s recipe for scrambled tofu with tomatoes, scallions and soy sauce? (In keeping with Tejal Rao’s brilliant idea to pair vegan ranch dressing with grilled lamb, we’re thinking you could add some ground pork to the recipe and be happy indeed.) Dessert:   oranges, sliced into eighths. Thursday night is dealer’s choice: Either make Julia Moskin’s recipe for avocado fattoush with mint vinaigrette or choose one from our collection of recipes for healthy weeknight dinners. And then for dessert, try the chef Seamus Mullen’s recipe for peaches, pistachios, honey and ricotta. Finally, maybe you’re looking to button up your plans for Rosh Hashana, which starts on Oct. 2? It’s never a good idea to cook something for the first time for a holiday. So for Friday night dinner (Shabbat, don’t you know!) perhaps you could give Melissa’s new recipe for chicken with figs a run? Or try David Tanis’s new recipe for baked spinach rice? If those don’t suit you, we have an entire recipe collection devoted to the High Holy Days. Other ideas for what to cook this weekend are on our site and apps. Save the recipes you like to your recipe box and rate them when you’re done cooking. You can and ought to leave notes on recipes if you have a shortcut or substitution to suggest the conversation among us helps us all. If you run into technical trouble, please ask for help: cookingcare@nytimes. com. (If your issues are more metaphysical, or if you have a complaint about tone or content, or if you want to gush or have suggestions about what we might be doing more or less of, you can reach me at foodeditor@nytimes. com.) Now, did you read Dwight Garner on Robert Gottlieb’s memoir in The Times? Please do. They’re excellent together. Did you see that Prince Buster, the trailblazer of Jamaican ska, died recently at 78? If you’d like to see some cool old videos and listen to his music, there’s a pretty cool “bead” on Milq devoted to ska and rocksteady. Check that out. Finally, let’s see what Gao Gao, Bai Yun and Xiao Liwu are up to. Yes, it’s Panda Cam from the San Diego Zoo. You’ll like it. See you tomorrow.
