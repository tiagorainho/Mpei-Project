Here they come, the freckled and pale, the dark and brooding alike. St. Patrick’s Day is upon us in Manhattan, a SantaCon in green. If you didn’t corn your own beef for dinner tonight, you can still buy a bag of the processed variety and simmer it off, or stop at the best deli in town to buy a couple of pounds. Crisp what you have under the broiler: Irish tacos are on the menu as promised, and they’re as fine as the air in Gweedore. What I’d like to cook this weekend: red flannel hash, off instruction Mark Bittman got a few years ago from the chef Jessica Koslow, of Sqirl in Los Angeles, to use up my leftover corned beef. Put some eggs on that and you’ll be in heaven. Also: these giant sourdough pancakes studded with fruit that Tejal Rao just wrote about this week in her sweet column for The New York Times Magazine. (You do have a sourdough starter, right? We talked about this a year ago!) Wouldn’t it be nice this weekend to learn to bake a soufflé? And to roast a chicken on top of all the bread that’s gone stale since you bought it fresh before the storm on Tuesday? You could roast tofu and squash. You could make lobster mac and cheese! And you could set yourself up nicely for a week’s worth of     desk lunches by making the best roast beef for sandwiches, a vat of black bean soup and (more Jessica Koslow action!) some brown rice for a midweek rice bowl with Swiss chard and chorizo. Those are all fine weekend projects. Thousands and thousands more recipes to cook this weekend are on Cooking. (Do you dare make Florence Fabricant’s new recipe for an oyster and blue cheese pie, which uses a cool technique for cooking the oysters that she learned from the chef Fredrik Berselius of the Nordic restaurant Aska, in Brooklyn?) See what you find. Save the ones you’re interested in making to your recipe box. And then rate them when you’re finished cooking and eating. You can  —   and should!  —   leave notes on the recipes for yourself or for the public, at least if you have an interesting point to make about the process of cooking them, or successful ingredient substitutions to trumpet. And, of course, if you run into trouble with the technology or the recipes themselves, do ask for help. We’re at cookingcare@nytimes. com. Now, in case you were wondering what Irish politicians think of Beyoncé, here’s some good work from The Daily Edge. I was going to suggest that if you’re looking for a ribald thriller in the tradition of Bond, that you check out Gérard de Villiers’s “Surface to Air. ” But I can’t. It’s too racy! It’s like “007 Shades of Gray”! But do you think you could add rainbow sprinkles to this recipe, to complete the trifecta of   ingredients and techniques? Maybe! Have a great weekend. I’ll be back on Sunday.

Up for a clambake? Mark Bittman gave us a recipe for an ultimate clambake a few years ago that is deeply involved but really quite easy, and if you have access to beach, rocks and fire, it may make for a glorious summer feast this weekend. If you partake, please document your work, sending photographs or “stories” to our social accounts on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook. We’ll send ’em around proudly. #NYTCooking! #NYTClambake! Less complicated but no less an awesome weekend activity would be to make the recipe for cold lobster with lobster mayonnaise that Mark and I ginned up a while back for a dinner party here in New York. You could grill some pizzas. You could make Kim Severson’s recipe for tamarind shrimp with coconut milk. Or you could just make Florence Fabricant’s recipe for chicken paillards with corn salad and watch the Olympics like a normal person. I’d love to make some pies this weekend. I’d be down to make fried chicken. I think it’d be nice to make David Tanis’s recipe for garbanzos and greens with chorizo. It’d be just as pleasurable to make the recipe for Jordan Marsh’s blueberry muffins, which Marian Burros brought to The Times back in 1987. And, as always, I’ll make a big batch of granola to eat for breakfast all next week with thick yogurt and plenty of fruit. How about you? Take a scroll through Cooking to see what appeals, and save the recipes you’re interested in making to your recipe box. Send them along to family and friends for review, either by emailing them or by posting them to social media, the bustling town square of our age. And then let us know  —   all of us in this growing community of cooks!  —   what you think of them by rating the recipes and leaving notes on them. Of course we’ll be standing by to help if anything goes sideways. Just reach out to cookingcare@nytimes. com. Now, won’t you join me in the wayback machine for this reprise of a road trip I took a decade ago to eat salmon in the Pacific Northwest? In more recent news, check out this promising dispatch from The Boston Globe about a rebound of cod in Newfoundland. (Or read this more depressing one from Outside: 10 normal people on the costs of living in a mountain town.) Finally, it is the Glorious Twelfth in Britain today, the opening of   season and, not incidentally, a day of rage for those who abhor the killings on the moors. Still, those of you who patronize   restaurants may see the birds showing up on menus some time next week. Look out! Have a good weekend.

A terrible week comes to an end with an awful anniversary, of last year’s massacre at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S. C. in which a gunman killed nine black parishioners during a prayer service. Hatred dogs us still, here and across the globe, offering violence, delivering grief. Hope, for many these days, is thin on the ground. Cooking can help. I think it can. Just follow a recipe. The process is mindful and therapeutic at once, a form that allows you to get outside your racing thoughts and self in order to provide for others. And providing for others is good it counteracts those who would take away from others instead. Maybe, anyway? It’s worth a shot. It’s what we can do. Spend tomorrow baking pies, or assembling a paella, or roasting chickens, or smoking beef ribs, and see what happens. You could make soft serve ice cream for the kids or the people in your life who act like kids. (You don’t need an ice cream maker.) You could make lobster mac and cheese, just because. Or   soft pretzels. Or   banana chocolate muffins. Or loaded nachos. How about a strawberry fool? You could make something you’ve made forever, a familiar kata, performed a thousand times. Or you could make something new and difficult, and surrender yourself to the magic of transformation: oats into granola basil into pesto pig’s feet and Madeira into the fantastical jellied pork stock the chef Fergus Henderson calls trotter gear. Perhaps it’s a weekend to make asparagus soup. Or a buttery breakfast casserole. You could make crab Newburg. Or some   spotted dog. There are thousands of other recipes to choose from on Cooking. Browse them for inspiration, then save the ones you like to your recipe box. Cook them, and revel in the peace that activity can bring. When you’re done, you can rate your work and, if you like, you can leave a note on the recipe to help yourself in the future, or to help others as they cook. As always, we’ll be standing by to help if you run into trouble with the technology or the recipes. We’re at cookingcare@nytimes. com. Outside of the Times bubble, you can find me on Twitter and Facebook, Pinterest and Instagram, where I use and monitor the hashtag #NYTCooking. Now, here’s a podcast to round us out, from Gastropod: “Who Invented the Cherry Tomato?” Have a great weekend.

1 - The political news cycle is fast, and keeping up can be overwhelming. Trying to find differing perspectives worth your time is even harder. That’s why we have scoured the internet for political writing from the right and left that you might not have seen. We would love to hear your thoughts on this collection. Send your feedback to ourpicks@nytimes. com _____ • From National Review: “To smear Neil Gorsuch, the Left has created and attacked a straw man. ” For originalists, there is a crucial distinction between “original intent” and “original meaning. ” This is a distinction that the writer David French believes gets erased by those who oppose the legal doctrine. _____ • From The Weekly Standard: “It is easier to decide who we don’t want here than who we do. ” What should United States immigration policy look like after some of the more contentious debates have been settled? Irwin M. Stelzer proposes a   solution. _____ • From The Federalist: “You thought Bane was a movie character turns out he’s a political avatar. ” Owen Strachan, a professor at Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, argues that at the root of the   movement is a group of young men who feel left behind by society. Troubled by the rise of the movement, but also critical of the progressive culture that he argues has silenced these young men, his prescription calls for, among other things, a “savior” who will call this group to maturity and  . _____ • From The American Conservative: “He apparently went to sleep shortly after Richard Nixon declared a ‘war’ on illegal drugs in 1971 and just recently awakened from his slumber. ” Attorney General Jeff Sessions recently equated marijuana and heroin use, arguing that the former was only “slightly less awful” than the latter. Ted Galen Carpenter, a senior fellow for the libertarian policy research firm The Cato Institute, argues that Mr. Session’s positions on marijuana make him the “Rip van Winkle” of drug policy. _____ • From Jacobin: “Originalist textualists are no less activist than their peers. They’re just less open about it. ” As Judge Neil M. Gorsuch’s Senate confirmation hearings draw to a close, Matt McManus explains why progressives should be wary of judges who consider themselves to be originalists. _____ • From Democracy: “It’s big, bold, and could fit on a bumper sticker. ” Here’s a policy plan we haven’t heard from the Democrats: Guarantee every American willing and able to work a job. That’s exactly what the writer Jeff Spross advocates in a piece that is part serious policy proposal, part theoretical mental exercise. _____ • From In These Times: “Heritage isn’t an appendage of the Trump administration’s radicalism. It’s the heart of it. ” Though President Trump is a Washington outsider, not all establishment groups viewed his victory in November as a defeat. In a cover story for the liberal magazine In These Times, Theo Anderson chronicles the   history of the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation and connects its longstanding agenda to the current administration’s proposed cuts to the federal budget. _____ • From New Republic: “In declaring the media the ‘opposition party,’ Bannon may have actually done it a great favor. ” Leah Finnegan argues that the media should shed its “pompous air of  ” and reverence for objectivity in favor of a   opposition to the Trump administration. _____ • From Lawfare: “Why are so many judges being so aggressive here?” What is behind the slew of judicial responses to Mr. Trump’s executive orders on travel? Benjamin Wittes and Quinta Jurecic explore the possibility that the judiciary doesn’t quite trust Mr. Trump’s oath of office. _____ • From The Chronicle of Higher Education: “For at least two generations, it has been leftist professors who were supposedly addicted to tearing things down [. ..] But the habit now seems to be spreading. ” Welcome to Claremont McKenna College, the academic home of the   movement. _____ • From The Smart Set: “I have been reading about the damned Mondragon cooperatives since the 1980s. Enough with Mondragon!” Michael Lind has no patience for the “false utopias” of ideologues on either end of the political spectrum. Read his ringing endorsement for political pragmatism. _____

Send your feedback to ourpicks@nytimes. com _____ • From National Review: “To claim that something is technically legal is not to say that it is appropriate. ” For Andrew McCarthy, the question is not whether it was legal to monitor President Trump or his associates during the campaign, but whether it was a political abuse of power. Read More » _____ • From The Weekly Standard: “The distribution of benefits is deeply contrary to the principles of republican government. ” Jay Cost evaluates the Trump administration’s federal budget along moral and historical lines, arguing that the Founding Fathers would have balked at the ease with which modern administrations  —   both Democratic and Republican  —   borrow money. Mr. Cost argues that high levels of debt betray the ideals of the Constitution and our moral obligation to future generations. Read more » _____ • From The American Spectator: “[. ..] is developing a work force for corporations what schools should be about?” Emmett McGroarty and Jane Robbins, senior fellows at the American Principles Project, argue that the Common Core and other progressive education policies focus, incorrectly, on preparing students for industry. School should instead instill the tenets of “traditional, classical education” that prepare students to be knowledgeable citizens. Read more » _____ • From Red State: “[. ..] the   conditions requirement is not some perk that we can keep while ditching the rest of Obamacare. ” Using a blog post by Senator Ted Cruz as a   point, a writer for Red State outlines the contours of a proposed bill for Republicans who have vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act. It begins, appropriately, with some bitter pills to swallow. Read more » _____ From The National Interest: “It defies logic that if we have made a bad investment we must continue to do so. ” Amitai Etzioni, a professor of international relations at George Washington University, recommends that President Trump abandon the   attempts of the two previous administrations and deny a request to send more troops into Afghanistan. Read more » _____ • From The Intercept: “Fight fewer wars and for narrower reasons, but be more barbaric and criminal in prosecuting the ones that are fought. ” One should not mistake Mr. Trump’s “ ” for “pacifism,” Glenn Greenwald warns. That distinction, according to Mr. Greenwald, helps to explain the precipitous increase in civilian casualties in the Middle East since Mr. Trump took office.

Read more » _____ From In These Times: “The fundamental failures of Obamacare stem from the law’s reliance on the private market. ” Miles   and Mr. Trump agree on one thing: Obamacare is going to get worse for millions of Americans. But according to Mr.   the only way forward for Democrats after the failure of the   American Health Care Act is to embrace a   system. Read more » _____ • From Politico: “The demise of the Republican plan [. ..] could open the door for bipartisan efforts to rescue the individual market. Don’t laugh it’s possible. ”  Sometimes, you need a mediator to help you find common ground. That’s why, hoping to encourage bipartisan cooperation, Timothy Stoltzfus Jost, a former law professor and consumer representative to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, identifies pieces of the American Health Care Act that could have earned support from moderate Democrats. Read more » _____ • From BuzzFeed: “Know your enemy and stop giving them ammunition. ” On this week’s “60 Minutes,” Scott Pelley interviewed the   blogger Mike Cernovich for a segment about fake news. But Charlie Warzel writes that Mr. Pelley was out maneuvered by the   figure when the discussion turned to “alternate universes. ” Mr. Warzel argues that reporters in traditional media must educate themselves about the new media ecosystem and not play into the hands of “The New Right media,” a collective armed with its own facts and reality.

That’s why we offer this piece by the Republican commentator David Frum with a bit of qualification. Here the former speechwriter for George W. Bush (who is also a staunch    writing for the   Atlantic) speaks to members of his own party to explain how the refusal to accept universal health care as a right has led to a “Republican Waterloo. ” Read more » _____

3 - Sam Sifton emails readers of Cooking five days a week to talk about food and suggest recipes. That email also appears here. To receive it in your inbox, register here. Good morning. I have a column in The Times Magazine today about a recipe for roasted potato hash that I’ve been messing around with for years now. It makes a superlative bed for eggs and an excellent side dish for steak. You could eat it with a mess of sautéed greens and be happy without the animal protein. You should make it entirely your own. Perhaps you could make it for lunch? And then for dinner tonight, you could try the recipe for braised chicken legs that I learned from the teachings of the California chef Cal Peternell, and sop up the sauce with Julia Moskin’s recipe for grilled garlic bread. On Monday night, you might go meatless and Balkan, mixing up David Tanis’s recipe for a Greek tomato salad and adding some crumbled feta if you like to make it really sing. Or you could go Brazilian in honor of the Olympic Games, with 10 recipes from that nation’s larder. For sure on Tuesday you could give Martha Rose Shulman’s recipe for   shrimp with spicy greens a try. Serve it with Kim Severson’s can’  rice and then settle in to see what the Olympics have to offer. (You’re not, like, in Rio, are you? If you are, or just want to imagine that you are, Florence Fabricant has a fine guide to the city’s best restaurant options.) Wednesday night could be good for a steak seared in a   pan and served with a platter of sautéed summer squash with red pepper and onion, along with leftover rice or a baguette and butter. Then on Thursday night just order a pizza and make Melissa’s recipe for eggplant with lamb, tomato and pine nuts while or after you eat it, in advance of serving a really incredible dish  —   one that benefits from overnight resting  —   on Friday night, as we head into the weekend. Thus fortified, you can wake up on Saturday morning, head to the market and return home to make jam. Go look around on Cooking to discover other things to cook this week. (This recipe for pork chops puttanesca, for instance.) And, if you like, tell us about what you make. We’re on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest, where we use and applaud the hashtag #NYTCooking. If you run into problems along the way, don’t hesitate to ask for help: cookingcare@nytimes. com. Or if you have a particular question about food or cooking, kitchens or life in and around them, submit it to foodeditor@nytimes. com. I’ll be collecting the best of them to answer in a forthcoming “Hey, Mr. Food Editor” column for Men’s Style. Now, see if you can’t find an actual print copy of The Times today. In it we have a beautiful special section devoted to an excerpt from Colson Whitehead’s new novel, “The Underground Railroad. ” Or, if you want to stay online only, try this fascinating account of life as a paramedic in the border town of Laredo, Tex. in California Sunday. Watch the trailer for “Little Men. ” Read Tessa Hadley’s new short story, “Dido’s Lament,” in The New Yorker. And watch Melissa cook the   “impossible meat” that you may have been hearing about, on Facebook. See you tomorrow.

3 - Sam Sifton emails readers of Cooking five days a week to talk about food and suggest recipes. That email also appears here. To receive it in your inbox, register here. Good morning. Nigella Lawson wrote a terrific article for us a few years ago about the pleasures of cooking ahead rather than, as the French put it, à la minute. She included in it a recipe that would become one of our favorites for fall: spiced beef in red wine. You could make that today, cool it, bag it in single portions and freeze them for use later  —   order in some Chinese food for dinner. Or you could just eat it for dinner tonight, accompanied by some rice, or polenta. Fall Sundays are great for   either way. On Monday night, if you’re not celebrating Rosh Hashana, maybe give Anna Jones’s recipe for a   spaghetti dinner with tomatoes and kale a try. As our Tejal Rao wrote last week, “you boil the raw pasta not just with water, but also with halved cherry tomatoes, lemon zest and greens. By the time the pasta has cooked, the liquids have reduced to form a thick, starchy sauce. ” At the start of the week, that sounds pretty great. Of course, if it’s not just the start of the week for you, but the start of a new year, maybe you’ll need more substantial fare. Cooking Melissa Clark’s  braised brisket with plums, star anise and port today will allow it to cure nicely in the refrigerator overnight. Reheat and serve! While you’re at it, give one of Joan Nathan’s new recipes for a Rosh Hashana dessert a try. Choose between a plum almond tart and an apple cider honey cake. Or make both. On Tuesday, maybe you could cook Melissa’s recipe for sweet and spicy roast chicken? (It’s awesome with couscous.) Or Mark Bittman’s  curried tofu with soy sauce? Wednesday, we’re eating fish. Would you like some salmon with parsley sauce? Or some arctic char with spinach butter? If it’s chilly enough, and you have a fireplace (lucky you) you could make Tamar Adler’s  fireplace trout. Read Trollope afterward by candlelight, and check on the horses before bed. Then, on Thursday, how about a warm bread salad to beat all bread salads, from the indefatigable Florence Fabricant, via the late, great Judy Rodgers? Accept no substitutions. And then on Friday night, you could wrap the week up with a big, fat turkey meatloaf. Or if that does not inspire, with a thick   steak. No? O. K. let’s make it a quinoa and rice bowl and call it a week. There are many, many more recipes on Cooking that you might make this week. Please save the ones you’re interested in to your recipe box, and rate them when you’re done cooking. (Share them around, as well, on email and social media: People you know need to see, right now, this easy, awesome Nancy Silverton recipe for roasted chicken thighs.) And if you run into trouble, or have something to tell us for good or for ill: cookingcare@nytimes. com. Operators are standing by. Now, do you know the term “subtweet”? Here’s an example of an excellent one, from Michiko Kakutani  —   and it’s not even on Twitter! See you tomorrow.

3 - Sam Sifton emails readers of Cooking five days a week to talk about food and suggest recipes. That email also appears here. To receive it in your inbox, register here. Good morning. Here’s the plan for the week, not including breakfast because I’m on a farina kick and that’s not to everyone’s taste, and not including lunch because really when it comes to the midday hours you should get out of the office or the house and walk around. If you get something to eat, great, but the most important thing is to be outside where the stories are. There’s nothing happening at your desk but a screen. Anyway! I’m thinking chicken paprikash for dinner tonight, a nod toward the coming fall, served over buttery egg noodles, with green beans on the side. If you have the time, make an apple cake for dessert. On Monday night, it would be great to eat falafel, but that means you’ll need to get and soak some dried chickpeas this evening. Fry them on Monday, and eat cut watermelon for dessert. Then on Tuesday, you could simmer Melissa Clark’s outstanding recipe for a smoky fish chowder into existence, serve it with soda crackers, and offer ice cream for dessert. (You can make your own. We’ve been grooving on Gifford’s recently, for what that’s worth.) Wednesday, maybe try Mark Bittman’s recipe for scrambled tofu with tomatoes, scallions and soy sauce? (In keeping with Tejal Rao’s brilliant idea to pair vegan ranch dressing with grilled lamb, we’re thinking you could add some ground pork to the recipe and be happy indeed.) Dessert:   oranges, sliced into eighths. Thursday night is dealer’s choice: Either make Julia Moskin’s recipe for avocado fattoush with mint vinaigrette or choose one from our collection of recipes for healthy weeknight dinners. And then for dessert, try the chef Seamus Mullen’s recipe for peaches, pistachios, honey and ricotta. Finally, maybe you’re looking to button up your plans for Rosh Hashana, which starts on Oct. 2? It’s never a good idea to cook something for the first time for a holiday. So for Friday night dinner (Shabbat, don’t you know!) perhaps you could give Melissa’s new recipe for chicken with figs a run? Or try David Tanis’s new recipe for baked spinach rice? If those don’t suit you, we have an entire recipe collection devoted to the High Holy Days. Other ideas for what to cook this weekend are on our site and apps. Save the recipes you like to your recipe box and rate them when you’re done cooking. You can and ought to leave notes on recipes if you have a shortcut or substitution to suggest the conversation among us helps us all. If you run into technical trouble, please ask for help: cookingcare@nytimes. com. (If your issues are more metaphysical, or if you have a complaint about tone or content, or if you want to gush or have suggestions about what we might be doing more or less of, you can reach me at foodeditor@nytimes. com.) Now, did you read Dwight Garner on Robert Gottlieb’s memoir in The Times? Please do. They’re excellent together. Did you see that Prince Buster, the trailblazer of Jamaican ska, died recently at 78? If you’d like to see some cool old videos and listen to his music, there’s a pretty cool “bead” on Milq devoted to ska and rocksteady. Check that out. Finally, let’s see what Gao Gao, Bai Yun and Xiao Liwu are up to. Yes, it’s Panda Cam from the San Diego Zoo. You’ll like it. See you tomorrow.

3 - Sam Sifton emails readers of Cooking seven days a week to talk about food and suggest recipes. That email also appears here. To receive it in your inbox, register here. Good morning. The bunting’s up, the beer cold in the fridge. There’s a lamb shoulder collapsing under the smoke of fruitwood out in the yard, and Julia Moskin’s salty pluff mud pie rests comfortably on the windowsill to cool. Independence Day is tomorrow, and friends will arrive to consume burgers and brats, ribs and potato salad, coleslaw, iced tea, prosecco, more. But today is for family. Today is for us. See if you can’t make it that way as well. Many of us here in the world of Cooking identify as hosts. The word has two definitions. The first is familiar: a person who receives or entertains guests. The second comes from biology and is a little grim: an animal in which a parasite or commensal animal lives. On holiday weekends, the former can sometimes feel like the latter. The best way to stay sane is to carve out a meal or two over the course of the weekend for the nuclear unit of family, even if the nuclear unit is one. So maybe make lamb sandwiches and that delicious pie. Or cook a simple omelet, according to the instructions of Jacques Pépin. You might try Julia’s recipe for a cucumber salad with yogurt, dill, sour cherries and, if you can find any, rose petals. Or you could make pad Thai and watch television. Make gazpacho and listen to Alejandro Escovedo and Ryan Adams sing “Castanets. ” Make Sunday a family day, and the coming holiday party will be all the more sweet. On Monday, you can go big with the cooking festivities. Eat leftovers on Tuesday night, with a big pot of rice and beans. For the Wednesday night meal, how about the recipe for flattened chicken thighs with roasted lemon slices that Julia brought to us last week, part of her awesome report on the state of the   pan? If you’ve got two of the things, you could also make her recipe for crisp toffee bars, an adaptation of Charlotte Druckman’s adaptation of a Maida Heatter recipe. It’s incredibly good. Thursday night, we could go for some salmon. Maybe my recipe for fillets roasted with brown sugar and mustard? Or David Tanis’s recipe for salmon with green sauce? Have you made Melissa Clark’s recipe for baked potatoes topped with salmon roe and crème fraîche yet? You really ought to, before the world grows too hot to bake. And then on Friday night, you can put on your host face again, and assemble a taco bar for everyone who wants to join. A simple search for “tacos” on our site yields many, many good ideas for such a dinner. I’m thinking fish tacos, myself. You may prefer them with black beans and chard. Just browse the site and apps, and save the recipes you’re interested in cooking to your recipe box. (Here’s mine, if you want an example of how big they can get.) Rate their success on a scale of one to five stars. Leave a note on a recipe if you have one to add to the conversation. By all means, share them with friends and family via email and the wonders of social media. And don’t forget: If you run into problems along the way, we’ll be standing by to help (cookingcare@nytimes. com). Now, have you read Lorrie Moore on Helen Gurley Brown in The New York Review of Books? Or considered what the Houston Texans defensive end J. J. Watt eats each day, according to GQ? Or heard Sampha’s new song, up on the Fader website? Do all of that in blessed solitude, then get into the kitchen and make life better for others. Have a great holiday.
