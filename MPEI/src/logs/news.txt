Send your feedback to ourpicks@nytimes. com _____ • From National Review: “To smear Neil Gorsuch, the Left has created and attacked a straw man. ” For originalists, there is a crucial distinction between “original intent” and “original meaning. ” This is a distinction that the writer David French believes gets erased by those who oppose the legal doctrine. _____ • From The Weekly Standard: “It is easier to decide who we don’t want here than who we do. ” What should United States immigration policy look like after some of the more contentious debates have been settled?

That’s exactly what the writer Jeff Spross advocates in a piece that is part serious policy proposal, part theoretical mental exercise. _____ • From In These Times: “Heritage isn’t an appendage of the Trump administration’s radicalism.

Benjamin Wittes and Quinta Jurecic explore the possibility that the judiciary doesn’t quite trust Mr. Trump’s oath of office. _____ • From The Chronicle of Higher Education: “For at least two generations, it has been leftist professors who were supposedly addicted to tearing things down [. ..] But the habit now seems to be spreading. ” Welcome to Claremont McKenna College, the academic home of the   movement. _____ • From The Smart Set: “I have been reading about the damned Mondragon cooperatives since the 1980s.

Send your feedback to ourpicks@nytimes. com _____ • From National Review: “To claim that something is technically legal is not to say that it is appropriate. ” For Andrew McCarthy, the question is not whether it was legal to monitor President Trump or his associates during the campaign, but whether it was a political abuse of power.

Read more » _____ • From The American Spectator: “[. ..] is developing a work force for corporations what schools should be about?” Emmett McGroarty and Jane Robbins, senior fellows at the American Principles Project, argue that the Common Core and other progressive education policies focus, incorrectly, on preparing students for industry. School should instead instill the tenets of “traditional, classical education” that prepare students to be knowledgeable citizens. Read more » _____ • From Red State: “[. ..] the   conditions requirement is not some perk that we can keep while ditching the rest of Obamacare. ” Using a blog post by Senator Ted Cruz as a   point, a writer for Red State outlines the contours of a proposed bill for Republicans who have vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act. It begins, appropriately, with some bitter pills to swallow. Read more » _____ From The National Interest: “It defies logic that if we have made a bad investment we must continue to do so. ” Amitai Etzioni, a professor of international relations at George Washington University, recommends that President Trump abandon the   attempts of the two previous administrations and deny a request to send more troops into Afghanistan. Read more » _____ • From The Intercept: “Fight fewer wars and for narrower reasons, but be more barbaric and criminal in prosecuting the ones that are fought. ” One should not mistake Mr. Trump’s “ ” for “pacifism,” Glenn Greenwald warns.

Don’t laugh it’s possible. ”  Sometimes, you need a mediator to help you find common ground.

The secret to her success? She’d rather persuade than entertain. Read more » _____ From The Atlantic: “I take no pride or pleasure in saying ‘I told you so. ’” In today’s political climate, it’s sometimes difficult to identify precisely where the “center” is.
