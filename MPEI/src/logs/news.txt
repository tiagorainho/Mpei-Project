One of the main measures set out is a temporary halt on the right to family reunion, in which   unaccompanied children can apply to have the German government fly their families over because of the human right to family life. The enormous number of unaccompanied youths  —   which includes anyone under age of 18  —   has led to an even greater number as relatives to the youths are shipped to Germany, prompting the change to get migrant numbers down for 2016. Yet the fact the majority of unaccompanied minors don’t register as asylum seekers and instead are given tolerated foreigner status means only 105 minors properly registered in 2015 would actually be affected by the change, reports Die Welt.

The attackers apparently demanded  money and the victim’s phone. One of the attackers reportedly understood no German at all, and it is believed that one of the pair carried a knife. The man is said to have no life threatening injuries, but does have stab wounds.

1 - (CNN) CNN commentators and guest analysts offer their take on Monday night’s presidential candidate debate. The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors. David Gergen: Clinton crushed Trump, but was that enough? Coming into the presidential debate, I thought that if Hillary Clinton won decisively, she would virtually lock up the election.  Coming out, it was clear that she did win decisively but I suspect that the campaign will remain ferociously close. By all traditional standards of debate, Mrs. Clinton crushed.  She carefully marshaled her arguments and facts and then sent them into battle  with a smile.  She rolled out a long list of indictments against Donald Trump, often damaging. By contrast, he came in unprepared, had nothing fresh to say, and increasingly gave way to rants.  As the evening ended, the media buried him in criticisms. QUIZ: Are you more like Clinton or Trump? Even so, I doubt she has put him away.  For one thing, Trump supporters aren’t judging him by traditional standards.  They have heard establishment politicians   and   for so long that they crave something different.  They were quick last night to see yet more signs of media bias.  Trump was an angry figure, yes, but he is also giving voice to their anger.  Those who are for him are likely to stick, despite his ineffectual performance.   Equally to the point, Mrs. Clinton seemingly struggled in the debate to create closer emotional bonds with voters.  She has been vexed with the issue of likeability throughout this campaign and in recent months her team has become concerned about her ability to mobilize millennials in the way that Barack Obama did so successfully.  Her arguments last night should have made voters think, but I am not sure they will make them march.   Perhaps I am wrong. Perhaps Hillary did lock up the race Monday night. Trump certainly blew it. But I imagine the race goes on, and the ultimate decision will be left where it should be: with the voters. Stay tuned for the vice presidential debate next Tuesday!

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. S. E. Cupp: Trump (mostly) did the job, I had two criteria upon which I would judge Monday night’s debate. Not ”who looked more presidential,” or ”who   whom the best.” Those aspects go to their bases, not the voters who will determine this election outcome: undecideds. Hillary Clinton had one job. She had to make Donald Trump look dumb. For undecideds, it will matter less that he’s a bully or a liar. She has issues with trust, too. What will scare them is how unprepared he is. Every chance she gets to point this out has the potential to add points. Unfortunately for Clinton, she didn’t take many of them. While she pointed out that his ”cavalier attitude” toward nuclear weapons was dangerous, time and again, she punted at opportunities to point out how   and unprepared Trump is. Instead, she preferred to argue his vague platform on its merits. For her, this wasn’t damaging, but it didn’t move the needle in her favor. In contrast, Trump mostly did the job he had to do. To move undecideds, he had to hammer one point home: Clinton is a politician who doesn’t get it. Over and over again, he attacked her as more of the same, out of touch, and a politician who hasn’t gotten it right. He didn’t go after her character or personal issues, for the most part    which voters know well. She outmanned him on specifics and details. But his attacks were far more effective than hers. While Clinton was right to suggest the   get busy on his statements    many were misleading    if I’m looking at who moved the needle tonight with voters, it was Trump, not Clinton. And, Robby Mook, I assure you, this   conservative isn’t grading him ”on a curve.” S. E. Cupp is the author of ”Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media’s Attack on Christianity,”   of ”Why You’re Wrong About the Right” and a columnist at the New York Daily News. Errol Louis: Where Clinton damaged Trump  Hillary Clinton did her homework on Donald Trump in the week leading up to tonight’s debate, and the prep work paid off, especially when it came to his business record.  The former secretary of state needled the Donald’s business record, hitting on   incidents and turning his claim to fame against him. She brought up his handful of bankruptcies, allegations that he’s stiffed workers, his pining for the housing crisis for his own benefit and his aversion to releasing his perpetually   tax returns.  ”It must be something really important, even terrible, that he’s trying to hide,” Clinton said of Trump’s tax returns, turning the tables on allegations that she’s hiding something in her deleted emails. ”It just seems to me that this is something the American people deserve to see.” Clinton even took a step further and pointed out that Trump didn’t pay any income tax returns in certain years, a strategy designed to chip away at the   demographic that he’s cultivated in the last few years. Trump, who’s worked up a populist campaign saying that the government has stiffed the little guy, put his own foot in his mouth, butted in and said ”that makes me smart.” Clinton came into the night    with Trump in key states like Colorado and Pennsylvania, needing to weaken her Republican opponent on some of the things that have made him strong. It’s a strategy her campaign has taken since July, when it rolled out an architect who claimed Trump shortchanged him over work at a golf course. (To twist the knife in his side, Clinton noted that the architect was in the audience tonight.)    It was a tough attack to which Trump will need an answer in future debates. Errol Louis is the host of ”Inside City Hall,” a nightly political show on NY1, a New York   channel.  Mel Robbins: Hillary Clinton got bad advice, As a Clinton supporter, it pains me to say Trump won. Clinton was too restrained, too smart    and as much as I hate to say it    she was too presidential.   And being presidential won’t help her win the election.  She spoke to the intellectuals tuning in she did not speak to the average American.   Her advisers told her to restrain from attacking Trump. She got the wrong counsel and it could cost her the election. Her rebuttal to Trump’s incoherent rants was to chuckle and tell viewers to check in with the fact checkers.  The fact checkers won’t win the election for her.    She needed to take him out at the knees.  We know Clinton is smart, what we needed to see was a woman who is tough and won’t take nonsense  from anyone.  She failed to do that tonight. Tonight, she was nice.  Nice won’t win the presidency.  Donald spent the night sniffing constantly before he spoke. To paraphrase one tweeter: He’s allergic to his own crap.   He lost the   vote but he won the debate and unless Clinton changes tactics he’s going to win the election. Mel Robbins is a CNN commentator, legal analyst,   author and keynote speaker. In 2014, she was named outstanding news   host by the Gracie Awards.  Tara Setmayer: Trump kept taking the bait, As a real estate mogul, Donald Trump is more than familiar with the expression ”location, location, location.” In presidential debates, it’s temperament, temperament, temperament. History has not been kind to Dan Quayle’s perceived weakness, George H. W. Bush’s time check or Al Gore’s sighs. And it won’t be kind to Trump’s undisciplined, defensive rants. Trump’s debate performance was a combined rehash of the insolence of his primary debates, the rambling hyperbole of his rallies, with a sprinkle of detail to bolster his message of economic populism. Although Trump scored points on that issue, he whiffed badly when confronted about his failure to release his taxes and struck out on the issues of race, birtherism and foreign policy. It was, frankly, surprising how easily Trump took Hillary’s bait. Coming into Monday night’s debate, national polls were essentially tied and battleground states were tightening. With expectations set historically low, all Trump had to do was behave well enough to convince undecided voters he was in fact fit to hold the highest office in the land. In order to win the White House, Trump needs more moderates, minorities and women to support him. Yet he engaged in juvenile attacks on Hillary’s looks and stamina instead of her failed record. Trump had an opportunity to put Hillary Clinton away and failed miserably. He is who is he is and continues to act unworthy of the office.  Tara Setmayer is former communications director for Rep. Dana Rohrabacher,   and a CNN political commentator. Follow her on Twitter @tarasetmayer.  Frida Ghitis: How Clinton unmasked Trump, Hillary Clinton was the closer. She pulled off a victory, but only after Trump looked as if he might run away with that victory in the first half of the debate. Clinton was clearly in command of the facts, but Trump was making the simpler    if highly inaccurate     case for defending American jobs. Substance aside, he initially came across as caring about those who have lost jobs to trade. But Trump’s initial strength unraveled as the debate progressed.  By the time it was over, Clinton unmasked Trump as a con man over his failure to release tax returns and penchant for not paying his workers. He all but acknowledged he doesn’t pay taxes, saying ”they would be wasted,” seeming more like an abusive   than a man of the people. His birther explanation made no sense, and his claim that Hillary has been ”fighting ISIS your entire life,” was as ridiculous as his notion of stealing Iraq’s oil. His denial of the   fact that he supported the Iraq war was a most awkward dance. Clinton’s decision to address America’s allies, reassuring them that the United States will abide by its treaty obligations, was a brilliant touch, a reminder that she was the true adult on the stage, particularly after highlighting Trump’s ”cavalier” claims, which he has made, that other countries  should arm themselves with nuclear weapons. First set was Trump’s. But Hillary handily won the match.    Frida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review, and a former CNN producer and correspondent. Follow her @FridaGhitis. Tim Stanley: A technical win for Trump, That was probably the first and last debate in presidential history to include a discussion of Rosie O’Donnell’s looks. As such, it was tremendous entertainment    pure reality TV. But it was also very hard to pick a winner. Donald Trump won on the basis of spectacle. Hillary Clinton’s strategy was to rise above the occasion and let him talk himself into losing. That actually allowed Trump to land one blow after another without Clinton fighting back. She wittily put him down a couple of times. But mostly she just smiled oddly at the camera. She was, to use a Trumpism, low energy. That was a mistake. Yes, Trump sunk to new lows when discussing the birther issue    claiming that he helped put it to rest when he actually stirred it up. Yes, he was barely coherent on defense, taxes etc. There was a   section when he detailed a phone call with Sean Hannity about Iraq. Yes, The Donald was low on specifics, too. But he did have clear themes that he rammed home. After 90 grueling minutes, I looked down at my pad and read back the key words that I’d jotted down. ”Law and order.” ”Country doing badly.” ”Bad experience.” ”Emails.” Clinton’s policies on solar panels and equal pay did not cut through. It could not compete with his passion, his articulation of populist anger. So I give this a technical win to Trump because he understood the format, he blew it apart, and he dominated the evening. But that will alienate as many people as it will attract. Moreover, I’m not even sure it’ll make that big a difference. Objectively deducing who won or lost is almost impossible when partisan tensions are this high. Most viewers either agree with him or with her. And a small minority watched it and thought, ”How the hell did things come to this?” The debate will likely harden impressions, not soften hearts. The impression is that Trump has matured into an effective champion of the working class. But Clinton looks like a   . Timothy Stanley is a historian and columnist for Britain’s Daily Telegraph. He is the author of ”Citizen Hollywood: How the Collaboration Between L. A. and D. C. Revolutionized American Politics.”   Roxanne Jones: Note to Trump: Talking loud a losing strategy, Out of control. That’s how I’d describe the first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. What a train wreck for any voter who wanted to hear details about policy. Instead, we got Trump shouting insults and   interrupting Clinton, trying to take over the conversation. Shockingly, Trump admitting to the world: He was ”smart” not to pay his federal income taxes he supported a return of ”stop and frisk” policing, even though it was ruled racial profiling and unconstitutional by the courts and he defended his family’s housing discrimination practices against blacks and Latinos, essentially saying it was just something everyone did back then.  Clinton’s       strategy was frustrating at times but it worked. She could, however, show more passion when discussing her policies. On the issue of race, Clinton missed a perfect opportunity to talk more about her plan for law enforcement reforms and systematic racism in our justice system. Still for me, Trump lost the debate tonight. Talking loud and saying little shouldn’t be a path to the White House. Score One for Clinton.

Julian Zelizer: Debate unlikely to have dramatic impact, Overall, it is unclear that Monday night’s debate will have a huge impact on the direction of the polls. The best moments for Donald Trump came in the first half hour, where he baited her into defending unpopular free trade deals. There were many reasons that Hillary Clinton supporters could be pleased with her performance. At several points, Trump was irritated and angry. He delved into some of his more controversial claims. He referred to Sean Hannity as evidence to support his claims about the Iraq War. Clinton consistently appeared poised and attacked with methodical precision. The most effective part of Clinton’s attacks was to connect him to a kind of   economics and raise questions about his business record. Clinton’s best moments came when she attacked him on birtherism. In the final half hour, Trump was mired deep in his Trumpian statements about women’s looks and more. But Clinton’s greatest advantage remains the dynamics of the Electoral College and the continued doubts about his capacity to be president. It is very hard for a single debate to change the game. And it is unclear that this debate had the kind of dramatic moment that will fundamentally reshape public opinion    overwhelming all of the other factors that have caused her lead to shrink. The most unfavorable moments for Trump are not worse than anything he’s done before    and those moments have not undercut his campaign thus far.  Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. He is the author of ”Jimmy Carter” and ”The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society.”  Haroon Moghul: Trump lost, but so did all of us, Near the end of Monday night’s debate, Hillary Clinton looked straight into the camera to address America’s allies. She wanted our friends and partners in NATO, and allies like Japan, South Korea, and others to know that we meant to honor our obligations. In that moment, Donald Trump entirely disappeared, and Clinton no longer looked like a candidate for President. She sounded like she was already President. Trump? He managed to incorporate his very large portfolio into nearly every comment he made. Eventually I expected him to announce he knew best how to defeat ISIS because he built a hotel in Mosul. So, yes, Trump lost. But we lost, too. All of us, as Americans. It’s a disaster for any democracy when there is only one responsible candidate running for office, let alone the highest in any land. Trump’s language over the campaign has been racist and authoritarian he has indulged   and winked at white supremacists when he was not busy with plans for mass deportations or Islamophobic bans. It’s not a good thing that 100 million people are watching these two candidates debate, because 100 million people shouldn’t take a   fascist seriously enough to debate his case for the White House. One of my favorite new shows is Netflix’s ”Stranger Things.” Unfortunately, we’re the ones living in the upside down.  Haroon Moghul is a senior fellow and director of development at the Center for Global Policy. His next book, ”How to be a Muslim,” will be out in 2017.  Ruth  : Clinton won hands down, Civility went south fast in Monday’s debate. Donald Trump lost his composure early, ranting, interrupting (over 20 times) and sniffing. (Under the weather, or out of his comfort zone?) Hillary Clinton started out soft, playing the grandmother card, but quickly escalated to tough talk and occasional sarcasm. It could hardly have gone otherwise. Clinton hit hard at Trump, bringing up his admiration of Russian President Vladimir Putin, his ”long record of engaging in racist behavior,” his denial at having supported the Iraq war, and his refusal to allow the American people to see his tax returns. In doing so, Clinton did Americans a big favor: she revealed Trump’s limitations. He is simply unable to make those leaps of imagination and generosity necessary to transform from a businessperson to a national political leader. The candidate who claims to do everything big showed the smallness of his thinking tonight. With his   rejoinders, he demonstrated repeatedly how he sees everything    people, properties, cities, and entire countries    in terms of how they factor into his business and personal universe, which seem to be one and the same. I’ll get to Pennsylvania Avenue one way or another, he said tonight, as though the White House and his new Trump hotel are entities of equal importance. Perhaps they really are, in his mind. Clinton alone demonstrated the composure, wisdom, and broad vision necessary for executive office. She won the debate hands down.

Her latest book is ”Italian Fascism’s Empire Cinema.”  She supports Hillary Clinton for the presidency. Raul Reyes: A sad night for ’Sniffles’ The reality TV star and businessman who loves giving nicknames earned himself one tonight: ”Sniffles.” From the beginning through the end of the first debate Donald Trump seemed to have something going on with his sinuses. It seemed a fitting metaphor for a night on which the usual expert showman was seriously off his game. Besides the sniffles, Trump made faces and sighed. He scowled. He interrupted. He took innumerable drinks of water, something for which he used to mock Marco Rubio.  In so doing, Trump lost this debate to a clearly     Hillary Clinton. Either Trump failed to prepare, or his prep sessions did not stick. This is a debate that will likely be studied in college communications, advertising, and gender courses for years to come. Without the benefit of a live audience cheering his   Trump seemed deflated and not on his best form at all. His constant interruptions of Clinton will do him no favors with women voters. His bragging, in effect, about forcing President Barack Obama to produce his birth certificate will not go over well with black voters. And his rambling answers at times descended into incoherence. In response to a question about cybersecurity, he mentioned that cyberattacks could be coming from ”someone sitting on their bed weighing 400 pounds.” Uh, what? Clinton did not let opportunities go by to score points with independents or moderate voters, reminding viewers that Trump once saw the mortgage crisis as a business opportunity, and she discussed race relations in thoughtful terms. Meanwhile, Trump made truly bizarre statements, such as she has been been fighting ISIS for 30 years! and ”  and Hispanics are living in hell, you walk down the streets, you get shot.” Note to Trump: Testiness is not a presidential look.  The fact that at several points Trump was arguing with moderator Lester Holt showed that things were not going his way. In one of the most notable moments of the night, Trump’s declaration that he had a much better temperament than Clinton earned spontaneous laughter from the audience at Hofstra University. As Trump might say: ”Sad.”     Unusual omissions tonight: No mentions of Trump’s feuds with everyone from a distinguished   judge to a Gold Star family. More glaringly: no discussion of immigration. Whether viewers agree with Clinton’s positions or not, she was able to articulate them in a reasonable and rational manner. She did well, and she knew it. She was obviously ready to discuss problematic issues like her emails. The grin on her face near the end of the debate was evidence that she was aware that she had had a great night. Once you’ve traveled the world, negotiated treaties, and testified before Congress for 11 hours, she said to Trump with a hint of mockery, then ”you can talk to me about stamina.”  Mic drop. Game over. Tonight at least, Hillary Clinton won. Raul A. Reyes is an attorney and member of the USA Today board of contributors. Follow him @RaulAReyes. Jeff Yang: Trump weaved his own hanging rope, This was a remarkable moment in American political history. Has there been a prior event in which a candidate has so completely and remarkably demonstrated his unfitness for the presidency, in character, temperament, preparation and aptitude?  Donald Trump’s   pattern of winning debates through sheer bluster and braggadocio was effective when he was facing a gaggle of opponents, all of whom had similar ideologies but less exaggerated stage personas. But faced with a single rival with clearly distinct ideas and experience and a staunchly unflappable attitude, he seemed rude, ignorant, volatile and churlish. Despite pundit assertions that Hillary Clinton had the burden of proof in this debate, the truth is that she simply needed to hold strong and let Hurricane Trump blow itself out. And she did. Sadly, moderator Lester Holt was a   in the debate. But his inability to restrain Trump proved an asset to Clinton, who spent much of the time leaning back and smiling to herself, knowing that her opponent was weaving his own hanging rope.  Jeff Yang is a columnist for The Wall Street Journal Online and contributes frequently to radio shows, including PRI’s ”The Takeaway” and WNYC’s ”The Brian Lehrer Show.” He is the   of ”I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action.”  Sally Kohn: Trump train derailed, Donald Trump’s supporters like to refer to his movement as ”The Trump Train.” Well, tonight The Trump Train went off the rails. Big time.   Admittedly, to many observers, the train was already way off track. Maybe it started the moment his campaign began, when he dismissed Mexican immigrants as ”rapists.”  Or maybe it was when he attacked Sen. John McCain. Or later, when he attacked a Gold Star family. Certainly, many Americans have paid attention to the media’s attempts at fact checking    including one report that Trump only tells the truth 22% of the time, and another that found in five hours of talking, Trump outright lied an average of every 3 minutes and 15 seconds.   But for those who somehow thought, up until Monday night, that Donald Trump might somehow be qualified to be president, Monday’s debate was a wakeup call. He seemed like a defensive, petulant bully who could only insult Hillary Clinton and America    and couldn’t offer a single solution, let alone details. He came across as not only dreadfully unprepared for the debate, but dreadfully unprepared to be president. Which is the truth. And it’s high time all Americans know it.   But don’t believe me. I’m obviously biased. Believe Frank Luntz. In his live focus group of undecided and leaning voters, just six people thought Trump won while 16 said Clinton was the victor. In moment after moment, the focus group preferred Clinton. For instance, Clinton’s response to Trump’s attack on her stamina scored better than Trump’s attack. And Hillary’s plan to defeat ISIS actually scored better  with the Trump leaners in the group than with the Clinton leaners.   In moment after moment, Hillary Clinton presented a knowledgeable and   vision for how to help working families and continue America on the path to security and prosperity. Donald Trump, in contrast, lied, and got defensive. He was petty and insulting, and then lied some more. Lies apparently can only get the Trump train so far. Eventually it runs out of steam.   Hillary Clinton showed herself to be the kind of person you want in the White House.  And Donald Trump showed himself to be the kind of kindergartner who should have his train taken away and instead given a timeout.  Sally Kohn is an activist, columnist and television commentator. Follow her on Twitter: @sallykohn.  She supports Hillary Clinton for the presidency. Buck Sexton: Trump needs stronger showing next time, The conventional wisdom going into the first debate was that Donald Trump would have to tone it down and appear more presidential. Trump definitely took a more staid and steadied approach, but it didn’t work. His bravado and charm were largely absent from the stage. Trump the showman can dance around policy pitfalls and distract from some of his less than successful business dealings. Sedate Donald had far fewer tools at his disposal, and looked like he couldn’t wait for the     to end.  Hillary Clinton didn’t give a memorable performance, but she didn’t have to. Most Americans expect Madame Secretary to drone on, joylessly, about policy, and wave her curriculum vitae like a club against her enemies.  She met expectations, which was enough, and during some of the actual policy exchanges clearly had the upper hand on knowledge and background. Trump had huge areas of vulnerability to exploit in his opponent, and he barely touched her on them    from Benghazi to her emails to the allegations of Clinton Foundation corruption. He will need a much stronger showing in his next debate or this thing will be over long before November.  Buck Sexton is a political commentator for CNN and host of ”The Buck Sexton Show” on TheBlaze. He was previously a CIA counterterrorism analyst. He has endorsed Donald Trump for the presidency. Nayyera Haq: Trump looked more like Grumpy Cat than a leader, Trump’s glass jaw was exposed throughout Clinton’s onslaught of policy laden  . Trump came into this debate attempting to appeal to a broader audience, so he needed to leave behind the showmanship and bravado that worked for him in the primary and instead carry himself with presidential composure. But his calm voice lasted only 20 minutes and his listening face made him look more like Grumpy Cat than a leader, showing that rehearsed moves just don’t work for him.  Trump had Clinton momentarily against the ropes early on about NAFTA and TPP, but then he allowed his emotion to take over and did not regain his own footing for the remainder of the debate. His heavy handed depictions of America’s problems didn’t hold up against Hillary’s detailed, solution oriented answers.  His snorting asides were countered with some surprising zingers from Hillary    ”Donald criticized me for preparing for this debate. You know what else I prepared for? To be President.” Trump crumbled under Hillary’s attacks on his business record, lack of transparency on taxes, and understanding of   communities. By the time it came around to national security, the contrast in experience was even more clear, with Clinton nimbly moving around the globe and Trump invoking his       he told us, is good at computers    in a discussion of cyber security. Trump’s abrupt defensiveness, especially on the issue of his temperament, allowed Clinton to come across as the champion of those who have been taken taken advantage of by big business and systemic racism.

1 - (CNN) CNN commentators and guest analysts offer their take on Tuesday night’s vice presidential candidate debate. The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors. David Gergen: Pence Lifts GOP Spirits  Governor Mike Pence did not change the underlying dynamics of the campaign Tuesday night, but he did provide a significant service to Donald Trump: he gave fresh heart to Trump supporters and may have stopped the downward spiral of their campaign. Democrats and many journalists argue that Pence succeeded only by throwing Trump under the bus, refusing to defend his boss from repeated attacks. But they miss the point: voters rarely scrutinize debates    instead making their judgments on the overall tone and performance of a candidate. Pence will not fare well with fact checkers, but his poise and polish played well with voters. For better or worse, style counts a lot in these debates.   Tim Kaine had a much sharper mastery of policy but was forced to play attack dog, a role that doesn’t fit his personality. His frequent interruptions didn’t help, either    he seemed less Rottweiler than fox terrier. And by the way, who screwed up his camera angle, so that he was often looking off into space instead of talking directly to viewers?  That wasn’t fair to him or the audience.   With a CNN poll showing a Pence victory, Republicans finally have reason to cheer again. Trump himself should see how much preparation paid off for his running mate. But now it is up to the candidate to show he can win at this game, too: the upcoming debate this Sunday in St. Louis is make or break for Trump.   David Gergen is a senior political analyst for CNN and has been a White House adviser to four presidents. A graduate of Harvard Law School, he is a professor of public service and   of the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School. Follow him @david_gergen. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Sally Kohn: Mike Pence is living on an alternate planet, Well it turns out, if you refuse to acknowledge any of the horrible things that Donald Trump has actually said, then it’s pretty easy to defend him.   This was the main takeaway from the vice presidential debate. Over and over again, Democratic VP nominee Tim Kaine tried valiantly to hold Republican Mike Pence accountable for the misogynistic, xenophobic,     things that his running mate Donald Trump has said.  And over and over again, Pence acted like Kaine was not only making these things up but, in so doing, actually perpetrating a campaign of insults simply by repeating the things that Donald Trump had said yet Mike Pence refused to acknowledge.  I’m pretty impressed that Kaine’s head didn’t explode.  Mine certainly came close. I don’t know how you debate someone who seems to have encamped himself on a different planet.  Yet to his credit, Mike Pence dished out his flurry of lies with calm confidence    while Tim Kaine, the   came off as ruffled.   In a moment in American media and political history where the very existence let alone definition of ”facts” seems worryingly debatable, I pray that the American people can still tell the difference.  Or else I pray that not that many people were watching  —   and that the   media will do its job of fact checking Pence for his downright lies and thus the impression most voters will walk away will be one closer to    well, fact.   Donald Trump has praised Putin.  Donald Trump has said it might not be a bad thing if more countries get nuclear weapons.  Donald Trump has said we should institute a temporary ban to prevent Muslims from entering the United States.  And Donald Trump has said Mexico was sending immigrants who are ”rapists” and called women ”fat pigs” and ”dogs.” No amount of vigorous head shaking on the part of his running mate changes this.  Donald Trump has said he would round up and deport every single undocumented immigrant in the country using a ”deportation force.”  Facts are facts.  We have literal recordings and transcripts. But if anything, the VP debate tests the relevance of facts in this election.  Donald Trump and Mike Pence’s strategy seems to be to repeat lies often enough to convince 51% of voters that they’re the truth.  And unfortunately, what actually is true doesn’t matter as much as what voters believe to be true.  Donald Trump has already bent the electoral process, the media and the boundaries of basic civility to his whims.  He may now bend the concept of fact as well.  Certainly, his loyal running mate is trying.   Sally Kohn is an activist, columnist and television commentator. Follow her on Twitter: @sallykohn.  She supports Hillary Clinton for the presidency. Errol Louis:  Pence gives lesson on how to defend Trump, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence went into Tuesday’s vice presidential debate burdened with saving the Trump campaign after one of its worst weeks. He emerged as the calmer, smoother counterpart to the erratic performance by Donald Trump during last week’s debate. Pence’s skillful performance was, in part, a product of the five years he spent as a radio talk show host, a job that put a premium on maintaining a clear and conversational tone and timing. To make his burden easier, Pence made as few references as possible to Trump, dancing around criticisms about his running mate’s tax returns, insults to a former Miss Universe and the constitutionality of his ”extreme vetting” plans. Instead, he spent the bulk of the night smoothing out what he dismissed as misinterpretations of Trump’s proposals. Even if he didn’t fully answer questions on race relations and questions on Trump’s business acumen, Pence was the cooler alternative to Sen. Tim Kaine, who came off as canned,   and nervous, interrupting Pence throughout the debate. Pence calmly dismissed assertions from Kaine with a chuckle, calling his points nonsense. That won’t eliminate all the political damage Trump has done with his nonstop insults and mockery, but it demonstrated to other Trump supporters how to defend their candidate without doubling down on his abrasive style. Errol Louis is the host of ”Inside City Hall,” a nightly political show on NY1, a New York   channel. S. E. Cupp: Kaine gave tone deaf, unhinged performance,   Just wow. Tim Kaine had one (fairly simple) job tonight: make the Donald Trump ticket look like the unstable one. Instead, for reasons only the late Miss Cleo might know, he was the one who was totally out of control. Sure, he laid out the differences between Trump and Hillary Clinton, hammered away at Trump’s rhetoric and asked numerous times how Mike Pence could defend some of Trump’s words and proposals. But who could hear any of that through the cacophony of hyperactive, ballistic outbursts and interruptions that marked most of the conversation? At one point, Pence mentioned   and Kaine interrupted to excitedly announce, ”I was there, too, by the Pentagon!” When he wasn’t interrupting, he was steamrolling through prepared paragraphs of alliterative dad jokes and scripted zingers that might have been effective    if they weren’t delivered at warp speed. And he was so wedded to his   mandate, he often seemed oblivious. In an answer to a question about the children of Syria    let me repeat, the CHILDREN OF SYRIA    his response was to point out that Trump didn’t pay his taxes.  Whatever substantive points Kaine made about Trump’s unpreparedness    and there were many, and they were important    were totally overshadowed by Kaine’s tone deaf, overly caffeinated, unhinged performance, especially when contrasted with Pence’s calm and composed one. If undecided voters were watching, Pence by far seemed the saner choice, maybe even in spite of his running mate.  S. E.

Tara Setmayer: Debate won’t move needle, Despite finishing a bit weaker than he started, Mike Pence was able to successfully execute his strategy better than Tim Kaine. Pence was unflappable throughout, while deliberately choosing to avoid answering any direct questions about his running mate’s litany of controversial remarks and positions.  By design, Pence took every opportunity to make the question a referendum on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama’s failed policies regardless of the question asked. This tactic forced Tim Kaine to play defense most of the evening.  Kaine was at his best when he listed many of Trump’s controversial statements and then challenged Pence multiple times to defend them, which he didn’t for the most part. However, Kaine’s incessant interruptions were off putting and undermined his own message.   Although Pence emerged the victor overall, it won’t move the needle at all for voters. Vice presidential debates rarely do. In this case, it simply reminded many Republicans how much different this race would be if a knowledgeable Republican who could effectively articulate the issues were at the top of the ticket instead of a   demagogue like Trump.

Tim Stanley: Pence delivers pleasingly banal performance, Now, that was the kind of polite and intelligent debate we used not to watch. Yes, the VP encounter was feisty, but never personally offensive    and its substance also felt incredibly old fashioned. The separation of church and state, a subject never mentioned in Trump v Clinton, was tactfully addressed memories of   were invoked both candidates agreed that Russia is a strategic threat. In fact, Mike Pence’s performance was so old school Republican that he seemed unaware of the reality of Trump’s iconoclastic campaign. ”Yes, I am happy to defend Mr. Trump,” he insisted, adding that Hillary Clinton was the lady with all the insults and Trump was a great and honest businessman. He was defending the Trump of his imagination. Kaine gave a spirited performance that was, to his detriment, wholly negative. If he couldn’t say ”But your candidate said XYZ!” then he wouldn’t have had much to say at all. Pence defused the antagonism with the wry smile of a genial old man humoring a simpleton    and won most rounds. He scored highly on law and order, insisting that there’s no contradiction between acknowledging that police racism exists and refusing to exploit tragedy for votes. So effective was his performance, so pleasingly banal, that many Republicans will be calling for the ticket to be switched. They do so forgetting that Trump’s radicalism deflects but does not diminish Pence’s: He was once considered a politically incorrect conservative himself, and any other year would have been regarded as a risky choice for VP. So this debate reinforced the impression that while the Democrat ticket is weak and unlikeable, the Republican one is eccentric. Pence, undeniably effective, won in large part by not being as bizarre as his running mate. Any momentum gained will doubtless be squandered by Trump himself.

Revolutionized American Politics.”   Jeff Yang: Pence edges    The overwhelming feeling one was left with after the first and only televised ”Second Chair Debate” was pointlessness verging on nihilism. Yes, each debater ”landed hits” and ”scored points.” But the debate will almost certainly have no meaningful or lasting effect on this particular election.  What we saw in Tim Kaine was a friendly, loyal, bland but upstanding (upblanding?) politician who ably filled his role as Hillary Clinton’s staunch defender, but who fell a bit short in executing the other half of his job, as the ticket’s designated attack dog. A bit too eager out of the gate, and nearly edgeless in his delivery, Kaine appeared to be more of a frantic puppy than a partisan pit bull. Still, he managed to come off as both human and humane, and certainly did no harm to the Democrats’ prospects.  Mike Pence, as others have remarked, was another story. Though he came off as articulate and informed, and far more measured and   than his     running mate, he did Donald Trump no favors as wingman. When pressed to respond to questions about Trump’s extensive lies, utter lack of transparency and fractal conflicts of interest, Pence simply evaded and dodged until moderator Elaine Quijano was forced to move on, causing the Republican to visibly exhale in relief. What we were left with was the sense that Pence sees Trump as a stepping stone to his own ambitions that he’s playing for 2020, not 2016.  In the end, Pence may have eked out a ”victory” in this sideshow, but hardly the overwhelming one the GOP accidentally predicted when it uploaded a prewritten Pence wins debate post on its website    before the debate actually began. Yet another sign of the lack of significance assigned to this   and one we perhaps should have heeded.

Most of us have known Hillary Clinton’s running mate as Uncle Tim with the jokes, and Mike Pence as the tortured soul trying to add respectability to Trump’s maverick campaign. Tim Kaine broke expectations, showing us the sharp leader who helped heal his state after the Virginia Tech massacre. Poor Mike Pence was stuck toggling between playing cleanup for Trump’s missteps and staking out substantive policy positions his boss still hasn’t clearly defined.  But the biggest surprise was how this debate exposed the looming cultural choice facing white men in this election. Trump lost women and minority voters ages ago    Latinos, and      not just with his flippant misogynistic and racist comments, but his doubling down in defense of policies that reflect those deplorable values. Yet, Tuesday’s debate drew a sharp contrast between the two tickets, laying bare the choice facing white, middle class voters using two people who look just like them.   Kaine made the case for how white men can back a woman for President, support local police while believing racial bias exists, and hold personal religious values dear while not pushing them on the broader public. Kaine used Trump’s tax record to hammer home that Trump cannot relate to middle class economic struggles. Pence helped Republicans feel their conservative values were still present in this election,  shoring up evangelical support for Trump, but doing nothing to appeal to a broader undecided audience. In a year that has often pitted white families against minorities in politics and in social justice movements, Tim Kaine made the stronger case for a broader coalition of American values.

The veep debate felt much like an extension of the presidential debate before it, as the two contenders on stage focused more on    targets than each other. Both Mike Pence and Tim Kaine hammered at the opposing side’s   president. Overall, substantive policy discussions took a rear seat to the back and forth of political attacks    and personal insults    directed at Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. This was a proxy battle, with each surrogate taking the biggest swings at the other team’s presidential nominee. As for the    aspect of it, Pence won the debate against Kaine. In tone and style, he came across as more measured, poised and statesmanlike. Pence also made a much more coherent case against Hillary Clinton    both on her record and her judgment    than anything Trump pulled together in the first debate. Pence had much more difficulty defending Trump’s record, however, as he often was left shaking his head without a response when asked about a specific Trump quote. Kaine was in full assault mode the whole time. His supporters probably enjoyed this, but stylistically he came across as rude, snippy and snide. He constantly interrupted Pence, engaged in so much crosstalk that it was difficult to know what anyone was saying, and repeated an endless string of talking points meant to undermine the Republican nominee while skipping over the moderator’s questions whenever Clinton’s weaknesses were at issue. It’s unlikely the debate will sway many voters in any direction, but perhaps Kaine and Pence’s feisty exchange is a prelude to a much more fiery event coming up between Trump and Clinton this Sunday.

Frida Ghitis: Pence smooth, but can’t defend Trump,   After Tuesday’s vice presidential clash, I have a suggestion for the Commission on Presidential Debates: Donald Trump should debate Mike Pence. Governor Pence, Trump’s choice for running mate, presented some interesting policy proposals to the public. They just didn’t sound very much like those of his current boss, Donald Trump. The most startling of all was Pence’s talk about Vladimir Putin, ”the small, bullying leader of Russia,” as Pence called him. Trump has praised Putin’s leadership qualities and warmly embraced the Russian autocrat throughout the campaign. A few weeks ago, during the    forum, Trump told Matt Lauer that Putin, ”says great things about me, I’m going to say great things about him.” Then he went on to rave about Putin’s high approval ratings. That’s the same Putin that Pence claims his team wants to forcefully take on. On Syria, Pence outlined a policy that does not resemble any of what Trump has said. Trump has spoken of attacking ISIS and leaving in place the dictator Bashar   responsible for far more deaths than ISIS. By contrast, Pence declared that American leadership requires it protect vulnerable citizens, including the children of Aleppo. Compare that to Trump’s tone on Muslims in general. Pence did make an effort to defend his running mate, but it was a bizarre tactic. When his challenger, Governor Tim Kaine, quoted Trump’s own highly offensive words, Pence repeatedly shook his head as if saying no, and laughed, appearing to deny the quotes that were almost all quite accurate. Then, when his turn came to speak, he did not refute Kaine’s statements citing Trump’s own words. But then, at one point, he did refute them. Kaine listed a series of Trump insults that all Americans have heard attacks against a Mexican judge, disdain for John McCain being captured in Vietnam, and others. Incredibly, Pence seemed to deny the words everyone has heard. ”If Donald Trump had said all the things you said he said in the way he’s said them,” he said, it would still not compare to Hillary Clinton’s ”basket of deplorables.” Pence tried to paint Clinton as the one responsible for running an ”  campaign.” But Americans have heard Trump. Pence’s smooth debate skills cannot erase that. Another Pence excuse, this one on abortion, won’t cut it. Trump told Chris Mathews that ”there has to be some form of punishment” for women who have abortions.” Pence excused it saying Trump is ”not a polished politician.” Pence is a polished politician. It showed in the debate. But he failed to defend Trump’s policies.

Haroon Moghul: Pence’s dishonesty is spiritually toxic, socially radioactive, When the five wizards arrived in Middle Earth many years ago, the shipwright Cirdan gave his Ring of Power to Gandalf, not the leading wizard, Saruman. Cirdan chose wisely: While Gandalf would rally men and elves against Sauron’s evil, Saruman not only conceded to tyranny, but embraced it. If there’s a reason Tolkien’s ”The Lord of the Rings” endures, it’s because it isn’t really fantasy. It is a kind of scripture. I’m not claiming Donald Trump is Sauron. I am, however, arguing that we can get an insight into what happened to Mike Pence by seeing how great writers explore the effect of power on the human soul. Sen. Tim Kaine repeatedly cited Trump’s most egregious comments, but all Pence did was deny Trump ever said any such thing. We have a   grouped term for that. Lying. Pence may have lied more than Trump did, and that’s a historic achievement.   So whether Pence loses the debate in the court of public opinion is secondary. Whether he becomes vice president almost does not matter. Pence’s dishonesty is not just spiritually toxic, but socially radioactive. If the top of your ticket indulges   moots war crimes, mocks veterans, shames women, and mines Breitbart for campaign direction, then you’re no different. What difference does it make if you’re not a racist, but you want a racist to become president? Donald Trump was the test God placed before Mike Pence, and he failed. That’s so much worse than losing. Haroon Moghul is a senior fellow at the Center for Global Policy. His next book, ”How to be a Muslim,” will be out in 2017. Lanhee J. Chen: If Pence had been at the top of the ticket. .. Mike Pence delivered a performance Tuesday night that left conservatives swooning and may have fueled the consolidation of Republican support for Trump.   He successfully prosecuted the case against Hillary Clinton, remained cool even under constant interruptions from Tim Kaine, and articulated a conservative vision of governance in the   era.   Some conservatives (including me) are left wondering how different this electoral cycle might be if Pence was at the top of the ticket instead. But while Pence’s performance Tuesday evening will be a bright spot in what has otherwise been an abysmal stretch for the Trump campaign, it’s not immediately clear whether a vice presidential debate will impact the race more broadly.  And over the next week, the Trump campaign will surely be asked to reconcile the differences in policy positions articulated by Pence and Trump on areas such as U. S. policy toward Russia and Syria.   It’s ultimately up to Trump to turn in a better performance on Sunday in St. Louis and again when he and Hillary Clinton debate in Las Vegas on October 19, if he wants to alter the trajectory of his own campaign. And, at the end of the day, while Pence presented very well, he’s not the one running for president.   Lanhee J.

He was the policy director on the   2012 campaign and participated extensively in preparing Romney for his debate performances.  Ruth  : Pence won, but Americans could lose, For much of the campaign, Governor Mike Pence has been treated by his authoritarian running mate, Donald Trump, as a kind of afterthought. Tuesday night, though, Pence demonstrated that he can best even Trump in the fine art of denial. Pence smoothly denied documented statements and actions by Trump, or else refuted the existence of the issue altogether. ”Ours is an   campaign?” Pence asked, as though he’d never heard anything so ludicrous. Most notably, Pence refused to talk about Trump’s racism. Pence sidestepped a question from moderator Elaine Quijano about the black Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina being stopped multiple times by police, and dismissed notions of implicit bias as ”badmouthing” law enforcement. He chided Kaine for ”whipping out that Mexican thing again,” as though calling Mexicans rapists should be no big deal. Pence’s astonishing ability to deny everything perfectly expresses the GOP leadership’s refusal to acknowledge what they have unleashed in America by nominating Trump. It helps to soothe the consciences of Speaker Paul Ryan, Senator John McCain, and all others who refuse to retract their endorsement of this rogue individual, no matter what he says or does.  Next to Pence, Kaine came off as irascible and unable to stop his interrupting and over talk. Pence won this debate, but Americans will be the losers if he and Trump prevail on November 8.

My review of the VP debate in two words: wack sauce. ..like what WAS that?! Two career public servants met on the debate stage to argue about who was more ”establishment.” Yet the challenge? Nobody knows their names. Tuesday night, the two VP candidates had an opportunity to be the chief spokespersons for their leaders while simultaneously assisting the American public in getting to know them better. Early on, I got the sense that Mike Pence laughed to keep from crying the entire night. I also thought his smug appearance, constant head shaking, and outcry that Tim Kaine’s mere repetition of Trump’s words were ”nonsense,” was condescension and arrogance.  Pence is probably wondering how he got here (until he realizes he was not likely to win a gubernatorial   anyway). He kept saying Kaine’s statements were nonsense. His strategy was simple: say everything Kaine says about Trump is ridiculous    pray you don’t get fact checked. Kaine would have one upped if he had said: ”you’re absolutely right. Your candidate’s disregard for humanity and dangerous rhetoric is nonsense    that nonsense has an audience and it has become poisonous and violent.” There were so many missed moments starting with the moderator: if she was fact checking, Kaine wouldn’t be the only one cutting Pence off.

Raul Reyes: Governor. .. please, ”Governor, please.” Those were the words of moderator Elaine Quijano, midway through the debate, as she tried to keep Mike Pence from interrupting his rival Tim Kaine. She could well have been articulating the thoughts of millions of American viewers, who might be excused for thinking that Pence did not know his running mate was actually Donald Trump. Time and again, Pence seemed most annoyed when Kaine recited Trump’s own words back to him. In the ”Battle of the Dads” Tuesday night, Tim Kaine came prepared to fight    and he clearly won the evening’s  . The sparkle in his eye as he landed his jabs contrasted nicely with Pence’s monotone delivery and occasional flashes of annoyance. Kaine pounded Pence with Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns, his murky ties to Russia, and his misogynistic and   comments. Kaine drove these points so repeatedly and strongly that at one point Pence sighed with irritation and said, ”You’ve whipped out that Mexican thing again.” Does he not realize that ”that Mexican thing” is one reason Trump is hitting historic lows with Latino voters? Kaine was fiercely   tonight. He did a good job in laying out the stark differences between Clinton and Trump on immigration, calling Trump’s plan ”Deportation Nation.” He crystallized the complicated abortion issue into one simple question, asking Pence why he didn’t trust women to make their reproductive choices themselves.   Still, Kaine failed to bring up one of Pence’s vulnerabilities    his history of   legislation cloaked as religious freedom. At a time when marriage equality is the law of the land and most Americans    especially young people    support LGBT rights, this was money left on the table. Kaine also missed the opportunity to mention the fact that Pence has accepted the Medicaid expansion in his state under the the Affordable Care Act    something at odds with Trump’s opposition to ”Obamacare.”          For his part, Pence struggled to explain how the Trump tax plans would benefit all Americans. He completely avoided Quijano’s question about dealing with homegrown terrorism, and when asked about North Korea nuclear policy, pivoted to discussing the Clinton Foundation. Tellingly, one moment when Pence did not have anything to say was when Kaine brought up Trump’s attacks on Judge Gonzalo Curiel because of his   heritage. Here, Pence’s silence spoke volumes. To be fair, Pence had the unenviable job of attempting to do damage control after Trump’s disastrous debate performance last month. But he really didn’t do himself any favors in the credibility department when he accused the   ticket of running an ”  campaign.” The facts say otherwise    ”Crooked Hillary” comes to mind    as even causal observers of the presidential race know. As moderator Quijano might say, ”Governor. .. please.” Raul A. Reyes is an attorney and member of the USA Today board of contributors. Follow him @RaulAReyes. Julian Zelizer: The start of Pence 2020? Both campaigns will find something to be pleased about with the debate. If Clinton wanted an    attack dog, Tim Kaine answered the call. He took some tough shots at Donald Trump and everything that the Republican campaign has supported. He reiterated most of the key talking points from the campaign, right from the start of the night. When Mike Pence brought up the Clinton Foundation, Kaine turned the conversation to what he sees as the much more egregious and less altruistic nature of the Trump Foundation. Most importantly, Kaine forced Pence into the uncomfortable position of being challenged to defend Trump’s most outrageous, polemical and insulting comments about women, Mexicans and Muslims. Mostly Pence   the points Kaine made. ”I’m just saying facts about your candidate, and you can’t defend him,” Kaine said when Pence complained about their ” ” campaign. But Pence achieved his goal in this debate, which was simply to provide some positive coverage for the Republican ticket and offer an image of the ticket that differs from everything Trump has conveyed. Of course, the bar was low after Trump’s performance in the first debate. Throughout most of the    Pence appeared calmer and more deliberative than his opponent. If Kaine wanted to provoke him in the same way that Clinton did with Trump, he was not able to do so. This time, it was the Democrat who kept interrupting and throwing out attack lines.  Pence was able to express some of the major lines of Republican criticism against Clinton’s policy record, something that Trump has mostly failed to do. He brought in the attacks on whether voters can trust Clinton without letting the issue overwhelm his argument. Pence scored some points by responding to the claims about Trump’s insults by pointing to Clinton’s line about half of Trump’s supporters being in the basket of ”deplorables”.   Kaine’s aggressive demeanor, filled with endless interruptions and jabs, will not play well with some voters. Pence’s statements about religion and abortion are sure to comfort some Republicans who are uneasy with their nominee. Republicans were absolutely desperate to halt the stream of negative news stories coming out about the Trump campaign that has dominated the past week and, in this respect, Pence achieved his goal.   The challenge for the Republicans though is that Trump is still at the top of the ticket, with all the negatives he has brought to the party. With Trump live tweeting insulting comments throughout the debate, the real question is whether this has any impact at all on the polls. There is little evidence that Trump will show any signs of remorse about his style or about his policies. Trump is also in the middle of preparing for a town hall debate on Sunday that will give Clinton a huge opportunity to use her seasoned campaign skills a second time around. In the end, it might be that Pence’s biggest accomplishment Tuesday night was to help him launch a possible presidential ticket of his own for 2020. Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. He is the author of ”Jimmy Carter” and ”The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society.” Roxanne Jones: Pence is polished, but Is that enough? When you know it’s wrong, just be quiet and move on. That was the strategy adopted by Governor Mike Pence at Tuesday night’s vice presidential debate when it came to defending his Presidential running mate Donald Trump.  Repeatedly, Pence declined to defend some of the more flammable issues surrounding Trump. On Trump’s not paying taxes, insulting immigrants, Muslims, women, business deals with Vladimir Putin’s Russia    Pence was mostly silent. Clearly, Pence does not believe in everything Trump is selling. No matter how many times Senator Tim Kaine tried to bait Pence, he stood firm, opting to defend his own conservative legacy and reputation instead of getting mired in Trump’s drama. Smart move.  Kaine, who it turns out, isn’t just a   nice guy, was a breath of fresh air. He came into the debate armed with information and talking points on Hillary, ready to pounce. And he seemed just the right amount of fed up. Maybe it’s the fighter in me, but I liked his fire. True, Kaine acted at times like an   kid trying to hard to impress us, but at least he wholeheartedly believes in what he and Hillary Clinton are trying to sell to the American public. He believes in her. Unlike Pence, Kaine doesn’t not give the impression that the main reason he’s on the ticket is to enhance his own political stature, or even worse, be a babysitter for a wayward president. Integrity matters. The win goes to Tim Kaine, by an edge.

2 - (CNN) Whitney Houston’s daughter Bobbi Kristina Brown was placed in a medically induced coma Saturday after being found facedown and unresponsive in a bathtub full of water, a source close to the family has told CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin. Brown, 21, ”was not breathing” when a man identified as her husband and a friend found her at about 10:25 a. m. inside her townhouse in Roswell, Georgia, said police in the Atlanta suburb. They called 911 and performed CPR until public safety officers arrived and took over, said police spokeswoman Lisa Holland.  Brown was taken to North Fulton Hospital, where ”she is still alive and breathing. Other than that, I don’t know her condition,” Holland said Saturday afternoon at a press briefing.  Nobody knows what caused Brown’s unresponsiveness, Holland said, but police consider it a medical incident at this time. She said investigators had found nothing to indicate it was   or  .  Police had been to the residence recently. Somebody reported a fight there January 23, but nobody answered the door and officers found no evidence of an altercation, Holland told CNN. The police spokeswoman noted one oddity in the case: ”Her mother died in the very same manner.” It was three years ago February 11 that Brown’s mother, renowned singer Whitney Houston, was found dead    in a bathtub    in The Beverly Hilton, hours before she was to attend a   bash there. An autopsy later revealed that she’d drowned facedown in ”extremely hot water” about 12 inches deep. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled it an accidental drowning with the ”effects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use” being contributing factors. Brown is her only child. ”She encourages me and inspires me,” Houston once said of her daughter. ”When I look at her eyes and I see myself, I go, ’Okay. I can do this. I can do this. ’” Daughter of acclaimed singer, RB standout, Brown was born in 1993 during Houston’s marriage to RB singer Bobby Brown, which ended in divorce in 2007. The daughter of music royalty became a public figure during the   reality show ”Being Bobby Brown,” in which she frequently appeared alongside her parents and often had a   seat to their marital fireworks. Mother and daughter even performed together on national TV in 2009, when the two sang ”My Love Is Your Love” in Central Park on ABC’s ”Good Morning America.” Given the pair’s close relationship, it’s no surprise that Houston’s death was a major blow. Days after her mother’s body was found, a grieving Bobbi Kristina    then 18    was taken to   Medical Center because she was ”overwhelmed,” family friend Kim Burrell said. ”She loves hard,” Burrell said then of Bobbi Kristina. ”She’s going to be OK, and we’re going to see to it.” Married a man who was taken in by Houston, Brown appeared on episodes of Lifetime’s brief reality show ”The Houstons: On Our Own,” which followed life for the family after Houston’s death. One of that reality show’s storylines revolved around Brown’s relationship with Nick Gordon, who lived with Houston and her daughter from the age of 12. Months later, Brown reportedly got engaged to Gordon.  And in January 2014, she tweeted out a picture of wedding rings, presumably belonging to her and Gordon, along with the words, #HappilyMarried• SO#Inlove.” ”(Houston) made me promise several times to look after Krissy . .. and, Mom, I will never ever, ever break that promise,” Gordon told the entertainment show ”Extra” afterward, saying Houston ”just treated me like she gave birth to me.” It was unclear whether Gordon came home Saturday morning to find his wife in the bathtub or had been in another part of the house overnight, Holland said. Police have obtained a search warrant to look through the house, but that’s standard procedure, she said. Concern for Brown surged again after news broke. Music director Michael Bearden sent along ”healing energy to the daughter of a late great friend.” Songwriter Diane Warren tweeted, ”I hope Bobbi Kristina gets the help she needs.” ”Poor thing,” Warren wrote. ”Almost 3 yrs to the day her mom passed and the same thing almost happened to her.”

2 - Atlanta (CNN) Whitney Houston’s daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, is on a ventilator and in intensive care, after she was found facedown and unresponsive in a bathtub full of water, a source close to the family said.  Brown, 21, was placed in a medically induced coma and the status of her brain function won’t be known until the sedatives are reduced, the source told CNN. ”It is going to be a waiting game,” said the source. Brown ”was not breathing” when a man identified as her husband found her Saturday morning inside her townhouse in the Atlanta suburb of Roswell, Georgia.  He called 911 and performed CPR until public safety officers arrived and took over, said police spokeswoman Lisa Holland.  The spokeswoman said when Brown was found, she was ”unresponsive, meaning not breathing, no heartbeat.” In scanner traffic, emergency services could be heard describing an ”  response”    urgent and life threatening    with ”possible cardiac arrest.” ”    female in the bathtub, facedown.

Bobby Brown requested privacy in a statement issued Sunday by his lawyer, who said that Brown was at the hospital with his daughter. ”Please allow for my family to deal with this matter and give my daughter the love and support she needs at this time,” Bobby Brown said.

Days after her mother’s body was found, a grieving Bobbi Kristina    then 18    was taken to   Medical Center because she was ”overwhelmed,” family friend Kim Burrell said. ”She loves hard,” Burrell said then of Bobbi Kristina. ”She’s going to be OK, and we’re going to see to it.” Married a man who was taken in by Houston, Brown appeared on episodes of Lifetime’s brief reality show ”The Houstons: On Our Own,” which followed her life after Houston’s death. One of that reality show’s storylines revolved around Brown’s relationship with Nick Gordon, who lived with Houston and her daughter from the age of 12. Months later, Brown reportedly got engaged to Gordon.  And in January 2014, she tweeted out a picture of wedding rings, presumably belonging to her and Gordon, along with the words, #HappilyMarried• SO#Inlove.” ”(Houston) made me promise several times to look after Krissy . .. and, Mom, I will never ever, ever break that promise,” Gordon told the entertainment show ”Extra” afterward, saying Houston ”just treated me like she gave birth to me.” It was unclear whether Gordon came home Saturday morning to find his wife in the bathtub or had been in another part of the house overnight, Holland said. Police have obtained a search warrant to look through the house, but that’s standard procedure, she said. Concern for Brown surged again after news broke. Music director Michael Bearden sent along ”healing energy to the daughter of a late great friend.” Songwriter Diane Warren tweeted, ”I hope Bobbi Kristina gets the help she needs.” ”Poor thing,” Warren wrote. ”Almost 3 yrs to the day her mom passed and the same thing almost happened to her.”

28 - ’Facebook is the most powerful media company the world has ever seen. It is also the most worrisome for traditional journalism companies because of how it has redefined ”news. ”’ ’On Wednesday, Facebook acknowledged something that folks in digital media  for a couple of months in the form of decreased referrals: It is changing the composition of the Facebook News Feed to favor more posts from friends and relatives  —   baby pictures, status updates  —   instead of news articles or entertainment posted by media companies.’ ”Some journalists like  seem surprised by this. Facebook has been making a lot of overtures toward journalists in the past couple of years with features like Instant Articles, which gives publications a way to display their pieces directly on Facebook’s mobile apps so that they load more quickly, and Live Video, which is being created by publications with direct paid subsidies from Facebook. Business Insider participates in both projects.” ’But Facebook is a weird beast that a lot of journalists still don’’t understand. That is because it has taken the definition of ”news” back to the era before mass media even existed. Yet, as a business, it looks exactly like a   company and competes aggressively for the same advertising budgets.’ ’Imagine the times before newspapers, radio, and TV existed. What was ”news”? What kinds of events did people talk about?’ ’They talked about things that happened to friends and family members. Things that happened in nearby places, or to relatives or old friends who now live far away. Occasionally a piece of what we would think of as news today was relevant enough to break through the noise  —   a new leader, a war, a disaster of some sort, an odd or unbelievable tale.’ ’That news spread slowly through word of mouth, often picking up slight changes and distortions along the way like a game of telephone.’ ’This is exactly what Facebook has created, only on a global scale, with zero time lag. Gossip and news are indistinguishable and transmitted instantly everywhere.’ ”This is what people want. Facebook has created an audience of more than 1. 4 billion people who check the site every month. That’s how it has become one of the two big players in online advertising  —   along with Google  —   essentially coming out of nowhere to grab the advertising dollars that used to be spent on traditional media.” ’While Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg talks often about free expression and connecting people, the company doesn’’t seem to understand or particularly care about   ”Journalism” as we know it today.’ ’It was  when conservatives leveled accusations of bias in its Trending Topics feature, which surfaces news stories that are supposedly trending among users. It had  on the fact that one of its board members, Peter Thiel, was secretly funding lawsuits against the media company Gawker.’ ”At the same time, Facebook’s flirtation with journalism wasn’t doing much for the business. Engagement on the traditional   kinds of posts  according to several reports. So lack of engagement plus all the bothersome ethical and moral questions that journalism companies deal with every day  —   who can blame Facebook for pulling back?” ’News publishers that thought Facebook was going to carve out a niche for them are in for the same kind of rude awakening that the   company Zynga experienced once Facebook users got bored with all of that sheep throwing.’ ”Easy come, easy go. But there’s still one way for traditional news publishers to thrive: Tell great stories that people love so much that they feel compelled to share them on Facebook, or wherever else. Forget the algorithm and go directly to the people.”

They had a business idea in their   back pockets  —   and now they’d finally have time to pursue it. ” ’   During a 1997 trip to Anguilla, where their parents, who were   travel journalists, were on assignment, Shep and Ian had started   talking about  ’ ” ended up telling the resort’s general manager about   their idea. ” ’   ”We didn’’t know how to do it,” Shep said. ”The hotel manager   literally pulled out the New York City yellow pages. We started   calling neck tie manufacturers. That’’s how it all started.” ’ ’   But when they got back to New York, they briefly put the idea on   hold. ’ ’   That was, until they quit their jobs the following year. ’ ’  ’ ’   Once they were able to start pursuing this dream in earnest, it   was time to break the news to friends and family. ’ ’   ”Everyone thought we were crazy for leaving our respectable jobs   to go try something new,” Shep says. ”My girlfriend, who is now   my wife, was not happy.” ’ ’   When they first started their company  —   which would eventually   become Vineyard Vines, the preppy clothing brand that’’s now worth   close to $1 billion,   —   the brothers didn’’t receive ”any money   from anybody,” says Shep. ’ ’   But they had a plan and they hit the ground running. ’ ’   They bought an old Jeep and a Ford Bronco with their last couple   of paychecks and applied for as many credit cards as possible   while they still had credit. Cash advances from the new credit   cards helped to fund Vineyard Vines in the beginning. They used   contacts at their old firms to make connections in the fashion   and design world. Soon, they accrued an inventory of ties. ’ ’   ”Nobody was really wearing ties at the time, unless they were   going to a wedding or a graduation,” Ian says. ”We thought,   people aren’’t wearing ties because they’’re boring. But we used   that to our advantage.” ’ ’   To make neckties more appealing to more people  —   especially   young, preppy New Englanders  —   their idea was to create a product   line with whimsical and colorful patterns that ”could spark   conversations.” ’ ’  ’ ”   To build up their brand, the Murray brothers took an outdoorsy   approach to finding customers who would appreciate their   preppy,   ties.

Ian adds: ”People constantly talked down to us  —   but we   took it as a challenge.” ’ ’  ’ ’   Almost 20 years after starting their business, the brothers say   they’’ve never regretted quitting their ”stable jobs.” Shep   explains that embarking on their new, entrepreneurial path was   far more liberating than it was scary. ’ ’   ”People want job security and financial security,” Shep says.   ”The idea of passing on something that was perfectly good didn’’t   make sense. The idea of being able to go out and make money doing   something as stupid as making neckties just seemed like a crazy   thing. The reality is, we were really passionate about going out   and making it on our own. We were really passionate about the   products we made. We felt that if we were passionate, other   people would be to.” ’ ’   Ian says that despite the rough patches in the beginning, the   brothers were able to rely on each other for support and found   that their different skill sets often complemented one another.

That’’s why so   many people early on identified with our products. Really early   on, we had George H. W. Bush wearing our bonefish ties, because he   loved to go bone fishing, and we had John Kerry wearing our   lacrosse ties, because he loved to play lacrosse.” ’ ’  ’ ’   Looking back on their old careers, the brothers say they ”miss   nothing.” They especially enjoy not having to wear suits anymore,   or commuting to and from New York City every day. ’ ’   When they first made the leap, Shep says they ”felt empowered by   being our own bosses, regardless of what anyone else thought.” ’ ’   He adds that his best advice for aspiring entrepreneurs is to   ”quit your job while you’’re young.” ’ ”   He notes it’s better to focus on pursuing your passion and   gaining varied and interesting career experience than it is to   suffer through a job that pays well or looks great on your   résumé. ” ’   ”Quality of life was more important to us than financial gain,”   Ian says. ”That still is what drives us and drives our team.

Bush wearing our bonefish ties, because he   loved to go bone fishing, and we had John Kerry wearing our   lacrosse ties, because he loved to play lacrosse.” ’ ’  ’ ’   Looking back on their old careers, the brothers say they ”miss   nothing.” They especially enjoy not having to wear suits anymore,   or commuting to and from New York City every day. ’ ’   When they first made the leap, Shep says they ”felt empowered by   being our own bosses, regardless of what anyone else thought.” ’ ’   He adds that his best advice for aspiring entrepreneurs is to   ”quit your job while you’’re young.” ’ ”   He notes it’s better to focus on pursuing your passion and   gaining varied and interesting career experience than it is to   suffer through a job that pays well or looks great on your   résumé. ” ’   ”Quality of life was more important to us than financial gain,”   Ian says. ”That still is what drives us and drives our team. It’’s   extremely rewarding to be around   people.” ’ ’   However, the brothers note that going for your dreams can get   harder as you age. They see many peers in their 30s or 40s who   feel unfilled in their corporate jobs, but are unable to leave   due to financial obligations. ’ ’   ”You don’’t want to go to your grave saying you wish you had tried   something,” Shep says. ”If you don’’t try it, how can you know if   you’’re going to succeed? I think a lot of people measure success   financially. If you do that, it doesn’’t necessarily always lead   to a happier, more productive life. Make sure you do things for   the right reasons.” ’

34 - ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’    ’ ”   Why are healthcare organizations beginning to embrace the   technology? Well, for starters, it’s because there’s more demand   than ever to make healthcare more efficient and effective. And a   lot of this demand stems from rising healthcare costs and   regulations, Greg Petroff, GE’s chief experience officer for   digital, told Business Insider. ” ’  ’ ’   For example, the Affordable Care Act signed into law in 2012   implemented a penalty for hospitals that have high readmission   rates. This means hospitals have to make sure their patients are   in a stable condition before they leave so they don’t return. But   it also means that hospitals are having to do more with the same   amount of resources. ’ ’   To help meet these new demands, hospitals are using IOT solutions   to capture and analyze data that enables hospital operators to   make smarter decisions that can help save money and lives,   Petroff said. ’ ’   “There are a host of things in a healthcare environment that are   managed on a daily basis. This includes medical equipment,   employees, and patients,” Petroff said. “In that environment we   can use these technologies . .. to determine how to improve   the quality of care, time to service, and to provide care with   less costs. ” ’ ’   One way GE has helped hospitals accomplish this is by bringing   medical equipment online.  ’ ’   For example, GE partnered with a hospital in New York to connect   and track hospital beds using sensors. These sensors enabled   hospital operators to tell when a bed was free and helped reduce   emergency room wait times by as much as four hours, Petroff said. ’ ’   And by connecting medical equipment, hospitals can greatly   reduce the chances of critical machinery breaking down when it’s   needed most. ’ ’   Philips Healthcare, for example, recently rolled out an IOT   solution called   which is a   solution,   that virtually monitors the health of its machines so that they   never suffer an outage.  ’ ’   “We want to make it to the point where Philips has zero downtime.   So our systems are operational all the time and are running at   peak performance,” John Romero, a support specialist at Philips   Healthcare, told Business Insider. ’ ”   When Philip’s   system detects that something is working   abnormally in the machine, it sends a text message to an engineer   so that repairs can be made before serious damage is   done. The   system is working so well that Philips is   exploring using the technology for other pieces of medical   machinery.  ” ’   While   is helping hospitals and other healthcare providers   avoid expensive repairs and replacements, it more importantly is   helping ensure patients are getting the care they need when they   need it, Romero said.  ’ ’   ”It’’s (IOT) all about   monitoring,” Romero said. ”And I   really think in the end as healthcare providers and hospitals, we   really need to put our patients at the center of all of our   thinking.” ’ ’ ’ ’     ’ ’ ’ ’Get updates in your inbox.’ ’Subscribe to Digital Industry Insider and never miss an update!’
